Collaboratives are groups of two or more organizations that apply for funding for a single program under one application. The application must be submitted by a single organization, which assumes the responsibility for submitting the application on behalf of the entire collaborative. The responsible applicant must be eligible to receive state funds (see ["Prequalification Steps"](/resources#icjia-prequalification-steps))--common recipients are a nonprofit organization, a local unit of government, a tax-exempt faith-based organization, a business organization, or other community organizations. 

Single applicants and organizations applying on behalf of a collaborative must also be registered and pre-qualified in the State of Illinois [GATA Grantee Portal](https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/).

## More about Collaboratives

A collaborative is a group that includes multiple partner organizations carrying out a single project together. Each member of the collaborative should share common goals but carry out specific roles within the program. For example, organizations within the collaborative may carry out the same program in different communities or for different populations. Organizations may also play different roles in the project, like providing different services to the same population.

Collaborative programs should have an inclusive and equitable structure, roles and responsibilities, and decision-making processes. Collaboratives must prioritize the needs of local partner organizations. Collaboratives should support the leadership of diverse, local organizations and stakeholders, and provide opportunities for local community-based organizations to build capacity as leaders in the program with the support of, rather than at the direction of, more established organizations.

Applications on behalf of a collaborative are submitted by the responsible applicant organization but should include a signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) from each partner organization expressing a commitment to work jointly to carry out the proposed program in the application.
