Collaboratives are groups of two or more organizations that apply for funding for a single cooperative program under one application. The application must be submitted by a responsible applicant organization, which assumes the responsibility for submitting the application on behalf of the entire collaborative. The responsible applicant must be a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, a local unit of government, or a tax-exempt faith-based organization. Other members of the collaborative may belong to these categories, but may also be local businesses, community and neighborhood associations that do not have 501(c)(3) status, and other organizations from the community that would like to participate materially in the proposed program.

Single applicants and responsible applicants applying on behalf of a collaborative should include in the application materials their determination letter of 501(c)(3) status from the IRS or equivalent documentation of their eligibility to apply for this grant.

## More about Collaboratives

A collaborative is not a separate organization, but rather is a partnership or coalition that includes multiple partner organizations carrying out a single project together. Each member of the collaborative should be selected based on their common goals in the project, but each should have a specific role within the program. For example, partner organizations within the collaborative may carry out the same program in different communities or for different populations, or partner organizations may have different roles in the overall project based on their particular strengths and capacities.

For collaborative programs we expect that the following elements would be in place and clearly documented:

- Collaborative structure and priorities are inclusive and demonstrate an equitable approach;

- Roles and responsibilities of collaborative partners are clearly defined and demonstrate an equitable approach; and

- Decision making processes demonstrate an equitable approach.

Applications on behalf of a collaborative are submitted by the responsible applicant organization, but should include Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) signed by all partner organizations expressing a commitment to work jointly to carry out the program proposed in the application.
