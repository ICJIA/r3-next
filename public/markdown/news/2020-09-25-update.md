The Restore, Reinvest, and Renew (R3) grant program application deadline was July 20, 2020. The community response to this grant opportunity was overwhelming and hundreds of applications for funding were submitted. Due to the unprecedented number of applications received, the review process is taking longer than expected. All applications have been distributed to reviewers and the review process is well underway. Review completion is anticipated no later than Monday, October 5, 2020. Final funding decisions will be presented and approved by the R3 Governing Board before applicants are notified of their status. Grant approvals will be complete and grantees will be notified of their status before or during December 2020.

Staff and reviewers are doing all they can to conclude this phase quickly while maintaining the integrity of the competitive application process. We will continue to keep lines of communication open. Your patience and understanding throughout this process is greatly appreciated.
