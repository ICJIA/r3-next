## R3 Grants

### Who is eligible to apply for R3 grants?

Organizations that serve residents of--or are based in--designated <a href="/eligibility">eligible R3 zones</a> will be able to apply. Eligible organizations include nonprofit organizations, local units of government, or tax-exempt faith-based organizations. All applicants will be required to demonstrate compliance with the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA).

In addition, other groups such as local businesses and community or neighborhood organizations without 501(c)(3) status are able to join a collaborative application. <a href="/collaboratives">Learn more about collaboratives here.</a>

### What types of projects are eligible for R3 funding?

Grant funding must be used to address: Economic development, Violence prevention, Re-entry, Youth development, and Civil legal aid. Two separate Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs) are available: one to fund a community assessment and planning process to determine which of these priorities will be addressed and how, and the other to provide the necessary service delivery.

### What assistance will be provided to applicants?

Before applications are due, ICJIA will provide technical assistance throughout the state to potential applicants. The technical assistance will contain information about how to write a strong application for state funding and how to become compliant with GATA and other state regulations.

### Is there anything I can do ahead of time to prepare?

Pre-qualification for ICJIA-administered state or federal grants is highly encouraged. Complete the prequalification process now and be ready to focus on other important aspects of your grant application.

### Who will decide what applicants are funded?

The bipartisan R3 Board will make funding decisions. The R3 Board consists of the Lieutenant Governor, state agency leadership, and legislators. Additional Board members will be appointed to represent the areas that are eligible for R3 funding. These Board members will consist of elected officials, service providers, violence prevention experts, and people who have been directly impacted by incarceration.

### How do I apply for a grant?

When applying for grant funding via a Notice of Funding Opportunity, applicants must concisely describe a specified scope of work, provide a preliminary program budget detailing personnel and equipment needs, and give an overview of their experience to implement their proposed program. Applications are competitively reviewed and scored.

## Eligibility

Click <a href="/eligibility"> here </a> for a map and table of all eligible zones.

### Who decided the eligible zones?

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) in coordination with JEO and a diverse group of researchers that represent academic institutions from around the state performed the <a href="/resources">analysis</a> to determine what geographic zones satisfied the conditions established by the R3 legislation. These determinations were then approved by the R3 Board.

### How were the eligible zones chosen?

The legislation states that eligible zones should have the highest rates of: Gun injuries, Unemployment, Child poverty, Commitments to and returns from the Department of Corrections. The areas are designated by census tract. Census tracts are geographic areas defined by the Census Bureau. <a href="https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/geographies/address?form">Enter an address here to find its Census tract</a>.

## R3 Board

### What are the R3 Board's responsibilities and who is on it?

In addition to approving and delivering grant funds, the Board is responsible for developing a grant application, monitoring the grant process, and delivering an annual report to the General Assembly and the Governor. The R3 Board consists of the Lieutenant Governor, state agency leadership, and legislators. Additional Board members will be appointed to represent the areas that are eligible for R3 funding. These Board members will consist of elected officials, service providers, violence prevention experts, and people who have been directly impacted by incarceration.

### Do Board members get paid?

Board members are not eligible for compensation, except for reimbursement of reasonable expenses.

### How will the Board hold grantees accountable?

Grantees will be required to provide data and other information to the Board to ensure that grant funds are used effectively and efficiently.

### How much money does the R3 Board have to distribute?

The R3 program receives 25% of net tax revenue from adult-use cannabis and has been allocated $10 million for the 2020 fiscal year. Depending on the growth of the cannabis market, the R3 Board may distribute up to $125 million per year in the future.
