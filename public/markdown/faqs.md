## R3 Grants

### Who is eligible to apply for R3 grants?

Organizations that serve residents of--or are based in--designated <a href="/eligibility">eligible R3 zones</a> will be able to apply. Eligible organizations include nonprofit organizations, local units of government, tax-exempt faith-based organizations, businesses, and other community organizations. All applicants will be required to demonstrate compliance with the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA).

Other groups that do not have an account with the State of Illinois [GATA Grantee Portal](https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/) are able to join a collaborative application. <a href="/collaboratives">Learn more about collaboratives here.</a>

### What types of projects are eligible for R3 funding?

Grant funding must be used to address: Economic development, Violence prevention, Re-entry, Youth development, and Civil legal aid. Two separate Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs) are available: one to fund a community assessment and planning process to determine which of these priorities will be addressed and how, and the other to provide the necessary service delivery.

### What assistance will be provided to applicants?

Before applications are due, ICJIA will provide technical assistance online to potential applicants. The technical assistance workshop will contain information about how to submit a complete application for state funding and how to become compliant with GATA and other state regulations. If you would like to learn more about the workshop or register please visit: https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/registration

### Is there anything I can do ahead of time to prepare?

Yes!
<a href="https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/"> Get started on these pre-qualification requirements</a>.
Pre-qualification for ICJIA-administered state or federal grants is highly encouraged. Complete the prequalification process now and be ready to focus on other important aspects of your grant application.

### Who will decide what applicants are funded?

The bipartisan R3 Board will make funding decisions. The R3 Board consists of the Lieutenant Governor, state agency leadership, and legislators. Additional Board members will be appointed to represent the areas that are eligible for R3 funding. These Board members will consist of elected officials, service providers, violence prevention experts, and people who have been directly impacted by incarceration.

### How do I apply for a grant?

When applying for grant funding via a Notice of Funding Opportunity, applicants must concisely describe a specified scope of work, provide a preliminary program budget detailing personnel and equipment needs, and give an overview of their experience to implement their proposed program. Applications are competitively reviewed and scored.
<a href="https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/">Start here for information on pre-qualification requirements and then follow the instructions specified in the Notice of Funding Opportunity</a>. Also, take advantage of technical assistance provided with every grant opportunity.

### How can I find out when R3 grants become available?

R3 Notices of Funding Opportunity will be announced via CJ Dispatch, the ICJIA email subscriber list.

## Eligibility

### Who is eligible for R3 grant funding?

Click <a href="/eligibility"> here </a> for a map and table of all eligible zones.

### Who decided the eligible zones?

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) in coordination with JEO and a diverse group of researchers that represent academic institutions from around the state performed the <a href="/resources#icjia-analysis">analysis</a> to determine what geographic zones satisfied the conditions established by the R3 legislation. These determinations were then approved by the R3 Board.

### How were the eligible zones chosen?

The legislation states that eligible zones should have the highest rates of: Gun injuries, Unemployment, Child poverty, Commitments to and returns from the Department of Corrections. The areas are designated by census tract. Census tracts are geographic areas defined by the Census Bureau. <a href="https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/geographies/address?form">Enter an address here to find its Census tract</a>.
You may also search an address directly within the R3 map search bar to find out if it is located within an eligible census tract.

## R3 Board

### What are the R3 Board's responsibilities and who is on it?

In addition to approving and delivering grant funds, the Board is responsible for developing a grant application, monitoring the grant process, and delivering an annual report to the General Assembly and the Governor. The R3 Board consists of the Lieutenant Governor, state agency leadership, and legislators. Additional Board members will be appointed to represent the areas that are eligible for R3 funding. These Board members will consist of elected officials, service providers, violence prevention experts, and people who have been directly impacted by incarceration.

### Do Board members get paid?

Board members are not eligible for compensation, except for reimbursement of reasonable expenses.

### How will the Board hold grantees accountable?

Grantees will be required to provide data and other information to the Board to ensure that grant funds are used effectively and efficiently.

### How much money does the R3 Board have to distribute?

The R3 program receives 25% of net tax revenue from adult-use cannabis and has been allocated $10 million for the 2020 fiscal year. Depending on the growth of the cannabis market, the R3 Board may distribute up to $125 million per year in the future.

## R3 NOFO Questions and Answers

### Updated May 29, 2020

<div class="faq-indent">

#### Will grantees have to limit services to persons living in the eligible census tracts or can they simply make those census tracts the focus of service delivery?

Programs must serve community residents within the eligible areas, but clients in neighboring census tracts should not be denied services.

#### It is difficult to formulate questions before the RFP is public. Will there be ongoing opportunities to seek information once the RFP is posted?

Yes. You may email questions on the NOFOs through until 11:59 p.m. on July 16, 2020.

Email questions regarding the Assessment and Planning NOFO to: [CJA.R3Planning@illinois.gov](CJA.R3Planning@illinois.gov)
Email questions regarding the Service Delivery NOFO to: [CJA.R3Service@illinois.gov](CJA.R3Service@illinois.gov)
Email general R3 program questions to: [Mitchell.Troup2@illinois.gov](Mitchell.Troup2@illinois.gov)
All substantive questions and responses will be posted at [https://r3.illinois.gov/faqs](/faqs).

#### Downstate civil legal aid organizations cover large geographic regions. For example, within the Prairie State Legal Services 36-county region, there are 160 locations in 23 counties identified as R3 zones. Can a single application include multiple zones? If we wanted to place designated staff in, let’s say, Kankakee, Rockford, Peoria, and Joliet would we need submit separate applications?

All zones fall into funding regions. Applicant organizations may propose to serve multiple zones as long as the zones are located within a single funding region. Applicant organizations proposing to serve zones in more than one funding region must submit separate applications for each region.

#### Our building is not directly in a zone but on the other side of the street from a zone. Would we be eligible to serve any client in our facility, or only clients who resided in the zone?

To be eligible for funding, an R3 program must be centered around an R3 zone. If your building is located just outside of an R3 zone and many of your clients are from that zone, you may provide services to any client who comes to your facility. However, you must demonstrate in your application that a significant portion of your client base will be from the R3 zone to be deemed eligible for R3 funding. In addition, any outreach activities, advertising, or marketing geared toward new clients should occur within an R3 zone.

#### In that case, would my agency be eligible for local preference points for being in an R3 zone?

No. Local preference points are only given to organizations within an R3 zone. However, your agency may qualify for local preference points if at least half of your organization’s employees live within an R3 zone, or if you are in a collaborative with other organizations and at least half of those organizations are within an R3 zone.

#### Will there be any assistance toward writing the grants for community assessments and planning, and service delivery programs?

Yes. ICJIA hosted three webinars on May 19, 20, and 21 to assist potential applicants. After these live webinars, the webinar recordings were posted on ICJIA’s YouTube channel:
Webinar #1
[https://youtu.be/F98-dkr6p-k](https://youtu.be/F98-dkr6p-k)

Applicants with limited experience in applying for state grants also are encouraged to take a grant technical assistance workshop. Workshops provide an overview of the state grant process and what it means to comply with the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA). GATA was created to ensure a coordinated, transparent process for efficient oversight of grant recipient selection and monitoring.

For more information or to register for a workshop, go to [icjia.illinois.gov/gata/technical-assistance](https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/technical-assistance).

#### What type of organizations can apply for R3 grants?

To be eligible for R3 grants, organizations must be based in or serve residents of eligible R3 areas. Organizations eligible to apply for this funding are nonprofit organizations, local units of government, faith-based organizations, businesses and community or neighborhood associations. All organizations must meet the minimum standards to receive state funds in order to be part of an application. More information on these requirements are at r3.illinois.gov/resources.

#### Is funding renewed annually for approved applicants or will they need to reapply?

Grant awards resulting from this opportunity will have a target period of performance of approximately 9 months, from September 2020 to June 30, 2021. Additional funding of up to 24 months may be awarded after the initial funding period based on program performance and availability of funds.

#### What are the determinants for R3 designated areas?

Areas were identified using community-level data on gun injury, child poverty, unemployment, and state prison commitments and returns, combined with Disproportionately Impacted Areas identified by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO).

#### How can people find out if the area their organizations provides services to is an R3 eligible zone?

View an interactive map of areas eligible for R3 Program grants at [r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](/eligibility). Type any address or municipality into the search bar. Addresses within the color-coded, shaded areas are eligible.

#### What options does my organization have if our application is rejected?

Unsuccessful applicants may request a formal appeal of the evaluation process via email and submitted within 14 calendar days after the date the grant award notice is published or receipt of a Funding Opportunity Declination Letter from ICJIA, whichever was received first. A debriefing may be requested for feedback using the evaluation and review criteria. Requests for debriefings must be made via email and submitted within 7 calendar days after receipt of notice.

#### Where can I find the R3 Notices of Funding Opportunity?

Access the R3 Notices of Funding Opportunity at [icjia.illinois.gov/gaga](https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata) or on the R3 website: [r3.illinois.gov]().

#### If you already receive state funding for your program, are you eligible to get funding for the same program through the R3 funding?

You may apply for R3 funding to expand programs supported with other state funds. R3 funds may not be used to supplant, or replace, other funds. Grants must be used to expand or enhance existing programs.

#### Can organizations apply for funding for services to currently incarcerated people who come from identified census tracts?

Yes, organizations may provide R3 services to individuals who are incarcerated but come from R3 zones.

</div>

### Questions and Answers from May 18, 2020 to May 21, 2020

<div class="faq-indent">

#### If our organization is headquartered outside of an R3 zone, but our service area is in an R3 zone, are we eligible? How do we find out what the R3 zones are?

Yes, you would be eligible to apply based on your service area being within an R3 zone. However, your application would not get local preference points based on your organization’s location. You can find the R3 zones by looking at the color-coded, shaded areas at the interactive map at [r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](/https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility).

#### If my police department is interested in this funding, but there are no R3 areas in our jurisdiction, would we be ineligible?

Only programs that serve R3 zones are eligible for this funding.

#### For the R3 Service Delivery NOFO, can we apply for more than one of the program priorities?

Yes. All R3 programs must address at least one of the R3 Program Priorities. Applicants may address more than one, or all five, as well. It is up to the applicant to decide how many of the program priorities should be addressed by the proposed program.

#### If our program addresses more than one of the program priorities, do we need to submit a separate application for each one?

No. You only need to submit one application, but your program narrative should include information about which of the program priorities your program will address and explain the program design for how each of these priorities will be addressed.

#### How do you define a program being “in” an R3 zone if programs are offered virtually?

Programs should be designed to serve residents of an R3 zone. If programs can be offered virtually, it should be intended to serve residents of R3 zones, should be geared towards the needs of R3 zone communities, and the focus of advertising and marketing to attract clients should be on the R3 zone.

#### Our organization is in three R3 zones, but the county jail that we serve is not. Are we not able to focus on that program?

R3 services may be provided to residents of R3 zones that are currently incarcerated if the services provided are focused on residents returning from prison or jail to their communities.

#### Is one application structure (single organization or collaborative) preferred over the other?

There are no points attributed to either application structure. Applicants should make their own decisions whether to apply on their own or as part of a collaborative based on which best serves their proposed program.

#### If we provide programming in a school, would the schools need to sign MOUs? Or is this only required for the organizations providing services?

For the application, only organizations applying together as part of a collaborative would need to sign MOUs indicating their joint agreement to be part of the proposed project described in the application. If the program in the application was granted funding, it may be determined that other MOUs would be needed for proper execution of program activities, but these would not be required at the point of application.

#### GATA qualification is a lengthy process. If one agency in a collaborative application has the pre-qualification requirements completed, can we move forward while the other agency is waiting for approval?

For collaborative applications, only the responsible applicant would need to have completed all of the GATA requirements by the time of application. If others have applied for a DUNS number, SAM.gov account, and other qualifiers they can be included in the application. However, they would not be able to be active as part of the project until they meet these requirements, so they would need to meet these requirements by the time they are ready to begin the program.

#### Can units of government apply as lead on a collaborative of nonprofits without selecting the subgrantee partners through a competitive bidding process (RFP)?

Yes. If a collaborative application is made, all members of the collaborative are identified in the application, and the responsible applicant does not need to choose subgrantees through a competitive bidding process. However, if additional partners that are not identified in the initial application are added, these partners would need to go through such a process.

#### Can you define or give examples of the R3 Program Priorities?

Additional information about each of the five program priorities are included in Appendix A of each NOFO, at the very end of the NOFO instructions. We recommend reviewing this material for more information on each Program Priority.

#### Can one organization submit two separate grants for the same program priority if we have two programs that both fall under the same priority?

Only one application for each NOFO can be submitted per applicant in any given funding region. If you want to perform two different program activities, but both can be incorporated into the same program and same application, you may do so. Alternatively, if the two programs fall into separate funding regions, an applicant may submit one application per funding region. In either case, one applicant should only submit one application per NOFO per funding region.

#### Are the program priorities described in the application documents?

Yes; the program priorities are explained in the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) instructions. Additional information about each of the five program priorities are included in Appendix A of each NOFO, at the very end of the NOFO instructions. We recommend reviewing this material for more information on each Program Priority.

#### How should you apply if you are serving more than one community?

If all of the R3 zones your proposed program will serve are within one funding region, you may apply under one application. If your program would span across multiple funding regions, you would need to submit separate applications for each funding region within which your program would operate.

#### Are we allowed to request funds to purchase and renovate properties to house formerly incarcerated individuals?

No, capital expenditures are an unallowable expense for these grant funds, so you would not be able to include these costs in the budget for the program.

#### What is the maximum dollar amount an organization can apply for?

Maximum (and minimum) dollar amounts for an application are based on the type of NOFO applied for (Assessment and Planning or Service Delivery) and on the proposed program’s funding region. Award ranges are shown on the map at [r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](/eligibility). Click on an R3 zone within the funding regions, or see Question 1 of the Program Narrative in each NOFO.

#### Are faith-based organizations eligible to receive funds under this program?

Yes, as long as the organization also meets the criteria to receive state funds listed in the NOFO. Nonprofit organizations, local units of government, businesses, and community or neighborhood associations are also eligible as long as they meet the criteria to receive state funding. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

#### Are you eligible to apply for this opportunity if you are a current ICJIA grant recipient?

Yes, your receipt of another grant does not disqualify you from this grant opportunity.

#### Only certain parts of our area seem to be in the eligible sections. If our location is in a section that is not an R3 zone, but all of the participants of the program will be from areas that are eligible, are we still allowed to apply for R3? Or would our physical location of the program need to be in a colored/eligible area? Our program location is two blocks from a priority area based on the map.

To be eligible for funding, an R3 program must be centered around an R3 zone. If your building is located just outside of an R3 zone and many (or all) of your clients are from that zone, you may provide services to any client who comes to your facility. However, you must demonstrate in your application that a significant portion of your client base will be from the R3 zone to be deemed eligible for R3 funding. In addition, any outreach activities, advertising, or marketing geared toward new clients should occur within an R3 zone.

#### If you are an agency that relies heavily on volunteers, would there be local preference points for those who reside in the R3 zones as they are the ones working most with clients?

Unfortunately, the local preference points based on employee residence only allow for local preference points if at least half of the employees of an organization reside in an R3 zone.

#### What is GATA?

GATA, or the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act, is a law that governs how grants are administered in the State of Illinois. The guidelines established by GATA determine who is eligible to receive grants, how grant funds are disbursed, what costs are allowable, and more. The GATA Grantee Portal is a system that helps applicants determine if they are in compliance with GATA requirements and therefore able to apply for funding through the state.

#### Can a single organization submit an application for both planning and direct services?

Yes, if an applicant believes that their community needs an assessment and planning process as well as immediate service delivery, the applicant can submit an application to each NOFO. However, keep in mind that since the Assessment and Planning NOFO and Service Delivery NOFO are different funding opportunities, the applicant would need to submit a separate application under each NOFO in order to be considered. One application cannot include both planning and service delivery program proposals.

#### Will the PowerPoint slides from the webinars be posted publicly?

Yes. In addition to the R3 webinars being made available on ICJIA’s YouTube channel, a PDF of the PowerPoint slides will be available at [r3.illinois.gov/resources](/resources).

#### How long does this grant last?

The first year’s performance period is approximately 9 months. It is estimated to begin late September or early October and will last through June 30, 2021.

#### While the first grant is 9 months, can we assume that successful grantees will continue to receive a second year of funding? It is a challenge to hire professionals for a 9-month job.

Applicants that are granted funding by submitting a successful application to this NOFO may be granted up to two additional years of funding after the first year, subject to continued appropriation of the funds, availability of the funds, and acceptable program performance. We intend to continue these grants if we are able to do so, but we cannot guarantee at this time that the grants will be continued.

#### Does my agency need to be a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in order to apply?

No. 501(c)(3) status is not a requirement. Eligible applicants include nonprofit organizations, local units of government, faith-based organizations, businesses, or other community or neighborhood organizations. Applicants must meet the basic criteria to be eligible to receive state funds. These criteria are: 1.) a DUNS number; 2.) a SAM.gov account; 3.) a Grants.gov account; 4.) Good standing with the IL Secretary of State; 5.) not on the State No-Pay List. In addition, single organization applicants or responsible applicants submitting applications on behalf of a collaborative will need an account in the State of Illinois GATA Grantee Portal.

#### Are there any upfront costs that we must have for starting up?

This will depend on the applicant organization and the proposed program. It is likely that organizations will have some upfront costs to start up a new program once grant agreements are finalized and services begin.

#### When do payments begin?

Selected grantees can begin their programs as soon as their grant agreements are signed. Organizations can request reimbursement on a monthly basis following that time. UPDATE: Grantees can apply to receive advances after the agreements are executed.

#### Our organization does not have a brick and mortar “location.” We consider our locations the schools that we serve out of. The mailing address we use is actually a UPS mail box. So in this case, should we use our school’s address for the location to determine eligibility and local preference points?

Since the program operates out of the school, you should use the school’s address to determine if you operate in an R3 zone and thus if you are eligible for these funds. However, you should use the mailing address of your organization when determining if your organization is eligible for local preference points.

#### Is it possible to get the GATA requirements completed by the due date of July 20, 2020?

Yes, all interested organizations should be able to complete the requirements before the due date. However, if you need to complete some steps, we suggest starting as soon as possible to ensure that you are eligible by the time you apply.

#### Some state grants are for a short time frame, and then limit funds for the second year to the same amount of funds as for the short period. Is that likely with these funds?

Continued funds for this program after the first year will be dependent on appropriation, availability of funds, and program performance of grantees. We hope to have more funds, so that existing grantees can maintain or possibly expand their programs, and to allow opportunities for new applicants. However, we cannot predict this with certainty at this time.

#### My organization does not have a building in an eligible R3 zone, but we do have a PO box in the community where we meet. Do we qualify?

As long as services are offered in an R3 zone, your organization may be eligible to apply. You do not need to have a building in that zone.

#### Will there be any point considerations for matching funds or in-kind contributions?

No. There are no points attributed to matching funds or in-kind contributions in the application scoring process.

#### Do we need to submit a separate application for each R3 zone that we plan to address?

If all of the R3 zones in your service area are in the same funding region, then you can combine them all into a single application. If the R3 zones are in different funding regions, you should submit a separate application for each funding region.

#### Can we apply for both as a single entity and with a collaboration for different areas?

You can submit separate applications as a single organization and with a collaborative as long as the applications are submitted in different funding regions and/or for different NOFOs. You cannot submit two applications for the same NOFO within the same funding region, even if one is with a collaborative and one is not.

#### How much funding is available?

While the final amount available will depend on the amount appropriated and the amount available in the trust fund for this program, we are estimating a total of $31.5 million in grant funds for this program ($3.15 million for Assessment and Planning, and \$28.35 million for Service Delivery).

#### Are the minimum and maximum amounts listed on the map and in the Program Narrative per application or per region?

The award ranges listed in the map and in the Program Narrative are minimum and maximum amounts per application.

#### Can we submit multiple applications if we work with multiple regions?

Yes, organizations can submit multiple applications as long as the applications are submitted in different funding regions. Organizations cannot submit more than one application within one funding region for the same NOFO. Keep in mind that there may be many R3 zones within a single funding region; if the applicant wants to work with multiple R3 zones in the same funding region, they should only submit one application for that project.

#### How are the high-need areas identified? Are they color-coded a specific color? Are some colors more high-need than others?

High need areas can be identified by an asterisk (\*) after the R3 Zone ID in the pop-up box that appears when you click on a color-coded, shaded area on the map at [r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](/eligibility). The different colors are to identify the different funding regions, so color differences do not indicate if an area is high-need or not.

#### Can the responsible applicant submit more than one application on behalf of collaboratives?

A responsible applicant can only be a part of one application per NOFO per funding region, even a collaborative application. They could submit separate applications for different funding region, but not within one region.

#### Can an organization submit one application that has both assessment/planning and service delivery program activities?

No. The Assessment and Planning NOFO and the Service Delivery NOFO are completely separate funding opportunities. They have different funding ranges, different Program Narratives, and different criteria. If an organization is interested in applying for both, the applicant would need to submit one application for each NOFO.

#### Are individual correctional facilities eligible to be lead organizations in applying for a grant?

Yes, as long as they meet the other eligibility requirements to receive state funds. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

#### Does civil legal aid include removing barriers to employment and providing assistance with license suspensions, etc? For ‘youth development,’ up to what age would one be considered ‘youth?’ Does ‘reentry’ mean helping people with criminal records, who might not have been incarcerated or who were incarcerated a long time ago?

The categories of the five R3 Program Priorities are not meant to be restrictive. If you would like more information on each program priority, it is recommended that you view the full NOFO and look at Appendix A at the end for more information. It will be up to the applicant to fully explain in their program narrative what the design of their proposed program would be and how their proposed program fits with at least one R3 Program Priority.

#### How many grants will be given per funding region?

This is not known, since it will depend on how many applications are selected and what amounts are requested in those applications. However, the program is set up so that we have the ability to fund more than one grant per funding region for each NOFO.

#### Can civil legal aid providers apply to cover just one area of work (i.e. domestic violence or housing) but not all areas?

The scope of the program is up to the applicant to define and to explain in the program narrative, as long as it addresses an R3 Program Priority. Applicants should explain what services are being provided and why these services (and not others that could be provided) may be needed in the service area.

#### Can a for-profit corporation submit an application as a single applicant or a collaborative lead?

Yes, if the corporation satisfies all of the eligibility requirements, including having a GATA Grantee Portal account, it can submit an application either as a single applicant organization or as a responsible applicant on behalf of a collaborative.

#### If the proposed start date for grants is September, does this mean that those grants approved for funding would not receive funds until that time?

Currently, grants are operating via a reimbursement basis. As such, it means that grants would not receive funds until after the start date for programs. If this changes, and advance payment is approved, we will post an update to inform applicants of this change.

#### When will FAQ updates be posted?

Updates to the questions and answers documents will be posted on Fridays, and we will update the document with any new questions received in the previous week, as well as answers to those questions.

#### Can an organization apply as a single organization and also apply with a collaborative with another organization as lead in different or same regions?

This would be possible if the two applications were in different regions, but not within the same region.

#### Is there somewhere we can go to view already-completed grant applications?

Unfortunately, we do not have the ability to post completed grant applications as examples. Since this is a new program, and this is the first round of applications for the program, there are no previously-approved applications that could be shared as examples. Other resources may have examples of generic grant application templates, but we cannot assist applicants in this area.

#### The NOFO packet describes a purpose of the grant to promote infrastructure. Could this be used for roadwork or infrastructure of the city?

No, the meaning in this context is to promote the networks of community organizations to provide support to residents. Capital expenditures such as roadwork or public works projects would not be allowable costs or allowable projects for these NOFOs.

#### Is the dollar amount of the grant range annual or for the cumulative 36-month project period?

The grant ranges are estimates for the first year’s project period.

#### What is the average or typical time frame for monthly invoices or financials submitted?

Reimbursements can take some time to process from receipt of the reimbursement request until the reimbursement is issued to the grantee. While we cannot predict exactly how long this takes, it can be anywhere from one to two months. We are exploring ways to reduce this wait time, and if any updates to this occur, we will post an update to inform applicants.

#### If the first grant period is nine months, do we request 12 months of expenses or do we prorate the requested amount to nine months?

Applicants should request the amount they estimate that they will need for the nine-month project period, including any start-up expenses that might be necessary.

#### Will reimbursement be by check or electronic?

Most reimbursements are via direct deposit, but grantees need to ensure that the Comptroller’s Office has the correct information (including payment method and details). If an organization is a new grantee, they will need to complete forms for the Comptroller’s Office containing this information.

#### To receive local preference points based on employee local residence, would half of the employees need to live in the same R3 zone we are applying for? Or can they live in nearby zones?

They could live in nearby zones, as long as they are also R3 zones.

#### If we are using the de minimis 10% indirect cost rate, is that 10% of our direct costs?

The de minimis indirect cost rate is 10% of your Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) base. The MTDC base excludes certain costs, such as occupancy and subawards over \$25,000. For more information on indirect costs, you can view the Indirect Cost recording on ICJIA’s YouTube channel.

#### Can you address supplanting? Does it refer to all funds or just government funds?

Supplanting means using funds from one grant (i.e. the R3 grant) to take the place of other grant funds in an existing program so that other funds can be used for other purposes. This refers to government funds, so R3 funding should not be used to supplant other state funding. Applicants for R3 funds should seek to provide new programs, or to expand or enhance existing programs, rather than simply use these funds to supplant others. Note that it is not considered supplanting if the funds being replaced have been discontinued, only if the funds are still available for use in the program but instead are put to a different use because of the availability of the R3 funding.

#### Can collaborations exist across R3 areas?

Yes. We encourage collaborations (both formal and informal) within and across R3 areas. Collaborative applications can cover multiple R3 areas as long as they are within the same funding region. However, grantees are also encouraged to work together informally even if they are not members of the same collaborative, and these informal collaborations are not bound by the R3 funding regions.

#### We are a county agency and therefore serve residents of the entire county. Are we allowed to service people that reside outside of an R3 zone in our county?

To be eligible for funding, an R3 program must be centered around an R3 zone. If your county contains one or more R3 zones and many of your clients are from those zones, you may provide services to any client who comes to your facility. However, you must demonstrate in your application that a significant portion of your client base will be from the R3 zone to be deemed eligible for R3 funding. In addition, any outreach activities, advertising, or marketing geared toward new clients should occur within an R3 zone.

#### If an organization has multiple locations, if one is in an R3 zone would our organization still qualify for funding/additional points?

The organization may be eligible for funding if the proposed service area is the R3 zone. However, organizations with multiple locations should use the primary address of their organization, not branch addresses, when applying local preference points.

#### What is the anticipated ‘average’ award size? What is the anticipated number of awards?

This is not known, since it will depend on how many applications are selected and what amounts are requested in those applications.

#### Could an organization apply as a single applicant to provide direct services in an area and then also consult with another organization that would also provide direct services in the area by expensing dollars for that consultant in the budget instead of doing a collaborative application?

This would be allowable, but it would be up to each applicant to determine if this approach is the best way to operate their programs.

#### I have two companies—one for-profit, and one non-profit. Do I apply as a single applicant or a collaborative?

We cannot give advice on how best to apply. Either the for-profit or non-profit could be eligible to apply as either a single applicant or as the responsible applicant of a collaborative, assuming that both meet the eligibility requirements.

#### Who are the people who will be reviewing and scoring the applications?

The application reviewers will be individuals from R3 zones who have experience in at least one of the five R3 Program Priorities.

#### If there are multiple R3 zones in a region, will all of those R3 zones be competing for the regional funding amount?

Strictly speaking, the R3 zones do not compete—rather, organizations proposing programs in those zones will be competing for the funding. However, the total funding amount for each funding region will be available to any applicant in that region, so if there are multiple R3 zones in a region, the resulting program funds may be split across those zones based on the applications that are selected for funding.

#### Are currently operating dispensaries allowed to apply?

If they satisfy all of the eligibility requirements to apply, there is nothing in the grant requirements barring dispensaries from applying for this funding. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

The grant agreement requires grantees to comply with all provisions of the Illinois Drug-Free Workplace Act, 30 ILCS 580/3, which prohibits the manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a controlled substance at the place where services are being performed. Therefore, dispensaries are prohibited from accepting a grant for work at the dispensary or any place where cannabis is being manufactured, distributed, dispensed, or possessed. The dispensary would be eligible to apply as long as it remains in compliance with this Act.

#### Are K-12 schools eligible to apply? Can post-secondary schools apply?

If they satisfy all of the eligibility requirements to apply, there is nothing in the grant requirements barring schools from applying for this funding. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

#### Are nonprofit hospital systems eligible to apply?

If they satisfy all of the eligibility requirements to apply, there is nothing in the grant requirements barring hospital systems from applying for this funding. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

#### We are already getting approached to join into collaborations for R3. We love collaborative projects but there can be issues when we get into the details. One detail issue for legal aid is sharing confidential client information with an agency that may be taking a lead role. In some grants, they allow the legal services reporting to remain independent of the other data. This means that there may be a client served by legal services that is also served with other project services but they do not demand the legal services to be part of an “unduplicated” count. Before we go too far down the road on collaborations it will be important to know the data reporting requirements. Is this something that you will be sharing on the webinars? If not, is this something ICJIA can consider soon? The other strategy is for our organization to do an independent application but plan activities in coordination with other who will provide other types of supportive services.

The grant agreement that will be executed between ICJIA and successful NOFO applicants states that the grantee (and sub-grantee in sub-grants) must comply with all applicable confidentiality laws. The agreement also states that grantee must do periodic reporting and participate in any evaluation project. To the extent there is any conflict between those mandates, you have to protect confidentiality. Also, please note that reporting and evaluation for our grants is based on aggregate numbers and not client personal information, which can also be redacted. For program reporting, ICJIA is interested in the numbers of services provided in terms of the goals and objectives identified in the program design.

#### Are high need areas identified in the R3 Table at [r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility) given priority for funding?

The high need areas identified in the table and identified by an asterisk on the map will receive additional points in the application review, but they will still be evaluated based on their total scores, as are all applications for the grant opportunity.

#### Can a regional organization submit an Assessment and Planning grant and a Service grant for the same region but different Census Tracts?

Yes. An organization can submit both an application for an Assessment and Planning program and an application for a Service Delivery program. The two applications are separate, so they do not need to apply to the same R3 zone.

#### Are units of government eligible?

If they satisfy all of the eligibility requirements to apply, there is nothing in the grant requirements barring units of government from applying for this funding. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

#### Is there a recording of the R3 Community Engagement Call that can be accessed online?

The link for the recording of the R3 Community Engagement Call is:
[https://youtu.be/VhK1F2vhGqc](https://youtu.be/VhK1F2vhGqc)

#### Is there a list of certified state grant writers that can help me complete an application?

We do not maintain a list of grant writers. Applicants are able to identify their own grant writers if they would like assistance in completing the application. ICJIA also recommends that applicants take advantage of the technical assistance sessions if they need assistance in becoming eligible for grants or applying for grant opportunities. For more information or to register for a workshop, go to [icjia.illinois.gov/gata/technical-assistance](https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/technical-assistance).

#### Can an organization join several collaborative applications for Service Delivery?

An organization can only be a party to one application, whether as a single organization or part of a collaborative, per NOFO per funding region. If the applications are within different funding regions, the organization could join different applications, but any organization could only be on one application per funding region within the Service Delivery NOFO.

#### Can this be used for Drug Court? Can it pay for a Drug Court Officer’s salary and benefits? Can it pay for drug testing probation clients? Can it pay for Drug Court rewards and incentives? Can it pay for Drug Court treatment/salary and benefits of a Drug Court Counselor?

The R3 program supports services in five different program priorities (civil legal aid, economic development, reentry, violence prevention, and youth development). For a program to be eligible to receive R3 funds, it must address at least one of those program priorities. It is an applicant’s responsibility to identify in the application how the proposed program addresses the chosen program priority or priorities.

I do not know all of the details of your drug court program, so I cannot specify one way or another whether the program would fit this requirement. However, you should consider whether the services provided under this program are services that focus on assisting community members rather than primarily supporting a government body’s operation. If your program provides needed services to community members in the five program priorities listed above, it could potentially be eligible. For example, it is unlikely that these funds can support operational costs of the drug court, costs of drug court officers, or costs of drug testing; but the funds may be able to support drug counselors, substance abuse treatment programs, or similar costs if they are related to one of the five R3 program priorities. If you choose to submit an application, it will then be evaluated by application reviewers who will consider the overall application, including the justification for the program design, and score the application according to the criteria in the NOFO.

#### Can a for profit organization economic development project for a full service live music venue that has a non profit component for music and drama programming for children-can this business apply? It does not look specifically exclude businesses but I just wanted to check?

For-profit businesses are eligible applicants to this grant opportunity if they satisfy all of the eligibility requirements to receive state funds. Businesses are not excluded from eligibility under this opportunity.

#### Each of the R3 zones within a funding region seem to have the same grant range. Because we are required to submit one application per region, if we are proposing to serve multiple zones with that region, are those ranges applicable to the full application or to each zone within the application?

The funding ranges are applicable to the application, not to the zones to be served. Therefore, if you intend to serve multiple R3 zones within a region, your application would not be able to exceed the stated maximum award amount, regardless of the number of R3 zones in your service area.

#### I'm interested in submitting a proposal for a R3 service grant but my proposal would include the creation of hygiene kits for local residents, which would include hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. In reading the Service Delivery Grant Instructions - Prohibited Uses: "implementation of a new program involving the use of chemicals" is listed. Would sanitizer and disinfectant wipes fall under the category of chemicals?

This prohibition does not cover the use of basic cleaning supplies. Hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, or other generally-available cleaning or hygiene items would be allowable costs under this NOFO. It is the applicant’s responsibility to explain in the Program Narrative how these costs are reasonable and support the proposed program.

#### Can a unit of government be a collaborative member (not a lead applicant) on multiple service delivery applications within a funding area? Specifically, we’re wondering if Cook County could be a partner on more than one application.

No. A single entity or organization (including a unit of government) can only be party to one application within a specific funding area, even if the entity is a member of the collaborative rather than the responsible applicant.

#### Is the expectation that all collaborative members would be receiving funding? Or not necessarily? Specifically, I’m wondering if our organization is a supporting partner but not seeking any funding via the grant, would we still qualify as a collaborative member for application purposes?

It is the expectation that all collaborative members will be receiving funding if the application is selected for funding. If your organization would like to support a collaborative application but does not seek funding via the grant, you may submit a letter of support, and the application may describe your role in the project, but you would not be considered part of the collaborative for application purposes.

#### Is this grant program intended to focus on gun violence, or should the term "violence" be considered more broadly? My organization focuses on gender based violence, and the NOFO is a little vague as to what type of violence is being prioritized by this funding.

While gun violence is definitely a major concern for this program, ‘violence prevention’ can be considered more broadly than just gun violence. The categories of the five R3 Program Priorities are not meant to be overly restrictive; we want organizations and communities to have the flexibility to focus on the needs that are most salient in their community. It will be up to the applicant to fully explain in their program narrative what the design of their proposed program would be and how their proposed program fits with at least one R3 Program Priority. Thus, if you can provide a good explanation in your statement of need for addressing a different type of violence, that explanation will be considered in reviewing your application. If you would like more information on each program priority, it is recommended that you view the full NOFO and look at Appendix A at the end for more information.

### Questions and Answers from May 22, 2020 to May 28, 2020

<div class="faq-indent">

#### Are cannabis businesses eligible to receive grant funding under the R3 Program, or is the cannabis industry excluded from eligibility?

If they satisfy all of the eligibility requirements to apply, there is nothing in the grant requirements barring cannabis businesses from applying for this funding. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

The grant agreement requires grantees to comply with all provisions of the Illinois Drug-Free Workplace Act, 30 ILCS 580/3, which prohibits the manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a controlled substance at the place where services are being performed. Therefore, dispensaries are prohibited from accepting a grant for work at the dispensary or any place where cannabis is being manufactured, distributed, dispensed, or possessed. The dispensary would be eligible to apply as long as it remains in compliance with this Act.

#### Could a grantee re-grant the funds via an RFP process to subgrantees?

Grantees may use this funding for subcontracts or subawards to other entities. However, the purpose and roles of the anticipated subcontracts or subawards should be made clear in the program design and will be considered in the review of the application. Subawards, and most subcontracts (depending on the amount of the contract and extent of the work) must be approved by ICJIA prior to any costs being incurred.

#### Will there be another NOFO next year? Or is this a one-time NOFO?

Applicants that are granted funding though this NOFO may be granted up to two additional years of funding after the first year, subject to continued appropriation of the funds, availability of the funds, and acceptable program performance. ICJIA intends to continue this program, with new NOFOs, for as long as grant funding is available.

#### Is the City of Chicago eligible to apply?

Yes, local units of government, including the City of Chicago, may apply under this NOFO assuming they satisfy all eligibility requirements. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

#### Would research projects be allowed under the assessment/planning grant?

Research projects may be performed as part of an assessment and planning grant, if the applicant determines that the research project is necessary to the assessment proposed in the application. The applicant would need to explain in detail the need for the research project as well as how the research project will be carried out.

##### I heard from someone that the materials state that only one grantee will be approved per region. That seemed incorrect because there are so many potential services. I was not sure if they were referencing the language in the application that states: “What region will your program serve? Refer to the map of R3 zones to find the region and select ONE. Only one application per region may be submitted. Separate applications must be submitted for each region served by your proposed program. Funding amounts are based on the population that lives in R3 zones within each region.” I am assuming that this means an independent organization can only submit one application in each region. Will ICJIA fund more than one applicant within a region?

Yes, ICJIA will fund more than one applicant per region. Organizations may only submit one application or be a collaborator in one application per region.

ICJIA expects to support many applicants/programs in each funding region, under each NOFO. Funding caps have been established to ensure at least two grantees for each type of NOFO will be funded in each region. The total number of programs funded will depend on how many applications are selected by the reviewers and how much funding is requested.

#### Is the R3 Assessment and Planning grant strictly designed to plan a brand new program and then sites are expected to utilize another funding source to implement and run the program, or can funds be used to implement and run a brand new program after the planning process has been completed?

The Assessment and Planning grant is designed to fund a process to determine what services are needed in a community and what resources are available, and to prepare a community plan for providing services in the community. Developing a new program is not required.

Funds under this grant opportunity cannot be used to implement the program of services. However, applicants who carry out an assessment and planning process may apply for Service Delivery funding under this or another NOFO.

#### If we are providing services to prisoners and detainees who are transitioning out, is the R3 zone where the prison is located or where the client is going to live?

The R3 program is intended to serve residents of R3 zones, so the relevant zones for these services would be the zones where the client resides or will reside upon leaving the facility.

#### On the “Service Delivery Program Narrative” document, question #4 states: Only organizations proposing to carry out an assessment and planning process for designated R3 zones are eligible for this funding. Please identify the zone(s) that will be covered by this assessment and planning process by listing the 4-digit “R3 Zone IDs” from this map of the R3 zones. As this is the Service Delivery RFP, and not the Assessment and Planning RFP, can you please confirm whether Service Delivery applicants must also complete an assessment and planning process as part of the Service Delivery grant?

Service Delivery granttes are not required to complete an assessment and planning process. The Service Delivery Program Narrative should read: “Only organizations proposing to provide services for designated R3 zones are eligible for this funding. Please identify the zone(s) that will be covered by this proposed service delivery by listing the 4-digit “R3 Zone IDs” from this map of the R3 zones.” A revised Program Narrative Document will be posted shortly.

To clarify, Service Delivery applicants are not required to complete an assessment and planning process as part of the Service Delivery grant.

#### Understanding that applicants are not to delete any template questions or document formatting, are applicants able to delete the instructions on page 1, the note for questions #14 and #15, the Budget Detail and Narrative description, and the Goals, Objectives and Performance Measures description?

Yes, instructions and notes within the Program Narrative can be removed prior to submission.

#### I have a question about clients who change location. We provide legal aid to prisoners as they transition back into the community. This often means helping them find suitable housing. If the housing is outside of the R3 zone, would we still be able to serve that client?

If the client was eligible for R3 services when you began providing those services, and then the client moved outside of an R3 zone, you can continue providing those same services and follow-up to those services to the existing client.

#### I’m hoping you can help me with a question regarding reporting requirements. I see a brief description on page 24 of the NOFO: “Recipients must submit monthly financial reports, quarterly program progress reports, final financial and progress reports, and, if applicable, an annual audit report in accordance with the 2 CFR Part 200 Uniform Requirements. Future awards and fund drawdowns may be withheld if reports are delinquent.” Are you planning to use a template for these reports? Or a database to collect data? My team is surveying staffing needs in connection with the reporting, so I am looking to get a sense of the complexity of reports.

Grantees will receive an Excel template to complete monthly financial reports and a Word template to complete quarterly program progress reports. Each grantee will be assigned to a grant monitor who can provide assistance, as needed.

#### Is there a maximum grant amount for which we can apply?

Maximum (and minimum) dollar amounts for an application are based on the type of NOFO applied for (Assessment and Planning or Service Delivery) and on the proposed program’s funding region. Award ranges are shown on the map at [https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility). Click on an R3 zone within the funding regions, or see Question 1 of the Program Narrative in each NOFO.

#### I can’t locate previous questions and answers. I’ve checked the ICJIA site and clicked on questions—it just tells you where to ask questions. Can you tell me how to access the answers to my question and other questions people have asked?

Questions and answers may be found at [https://r3.illinois.gov/faqs](https://r3.illinois.gov/faqs). They are also posted on the funding pages for each NOFO at [https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/funding](https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/funding).

#### My organization may not have the cash flow to start up our program and pay our staff while we await reimbursement. Is it possible to receive advance payments?

Grantees are able to request advance payment, subject to ICJIA policy. Grantees requesting advances must demonstrate need, itemize expected costs, and comply with Illinois Administrative Code regarding advance payments located at [http://ilga.gov/commission/JCAR/admincode/044/044070000B01200R.html](http://ilga.gov/commission/JCAR/admincode/044/044070000B01200R.html).
