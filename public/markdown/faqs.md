## R3 Grants

### Who is eligible to apply for R3 grants?

Organizations that serve residents of--or are based in--designated <a href="/eligibility">eligible R3 zones</a> will be able to apply. Eligible organizations include nonprofit organizations, local units of government, tax-exempt faith-based organizations, businesses, and other community organizations. All applicants will be required to demonstrate compliance with the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA).

Other groups that do not have an account with the State of Illinois [GATA Grantee Portal](https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/) are able to join a collaborative application. <a href="/collaboratives">Learn more about collaboratives here.</a>

### What types of projects are eligible for R3 funding?

Grant funding must be used to address: Economic development, Violence prevention, Re-entry, Youth development, and Civil legal aid. Two separate Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs) are available: one to fund a community assessment and planning process to determine which of these priorities will be addressed and how, and the other to provide the necessary service delivery.

### What assistance will be provided to applicants?

Before applications are due, ICJIA will provide technical assistance online to potential applicants. The technical assistance workshop will contain information about how to submit a complete application for state funding and how to become compliant with GATA and other state regulations. If you would like to learn more about the workshop or register please visit: https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/registration

### Is there anything I can do ahead of time to prepare?

Yes!
<a href="https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/"> Get started on these pre-qualification requirements</a>.
Pre-qualification for ICJIA-administered state or federal grants is highly encouraged. Complete the prequalification process now and be ready to focus on other important aspects of your grant application.

### Who will decide what applicants are funded?

The bipartisan R3 Board will make funding decisions. The R3 Board consists of the Lieutenant Governor, state agency leadership, and legislators. Additional Board members will be appointed to represent the areas that are eligible for R3 funding. These Board members will consist of elected officials, service providers, violence prevention experts, and people who have been directly impacted by incarceration.

### How do I apply for a grant?

When applying for grant funding via a Notice of Funding Opportunity, applicants must concisely describe a specified scope of work, provide a preliminary program budget detailing personnel and equipment needs, and give an overview of their experience to implement their proposed program. Applications are competitively reviewed and scored.
<a href="https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/">Start here for information on pre-qualification requirements and then follow the instructions specified in the Notice of Funding Opportunity</a>. Also, take advantage of technical assistance provided with every grant opportunity.

### How can I find out when R3 grants become available?

R3 Notices of Funding Opportunity will be announced via CJ Dispatch, the ICJIA email subscriber list.

## Eligibility

### Who is eligible for R3 grant funding?

Click <a href="/eligibility"> here </a> for a map and table of all eligible zones.

### Who decided the eligible zones?

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) in coordination with JEO and a diverse group of researchers that represent academic institutions from around the state performed the <a href="/resources#icjia-analysis">analysis</a> to determine what geographic zones satisfied the conditions established by the R3 legislation. These determinations were then approved by the R3 Board.

### How were the eligible zones chosen?

The legislation states that eligible zones should have the highest rates of: Gun injuries, Unemployment, Child poverty, Commitments to and returns from the Department of Corrections. The areas are designated by census tract. Census tracts are geographic areas defined by the Census Bureau. <a href="https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/geographies/address?form">Enter an address here to find its Census tract</a>.
You may also search an address directly within the R3 map search bar to find out if it is located within an eligible census tract.

## R3 Board

### What are the R3 Board's responsibilities and who is on it?

In addition to approving and delivering grant funds, the Board is responsible for developing a grant application, monitoring the grant process, and delivering an annual report to the General Assembly and the Governor. The R3 Board consists of the Lieutenant Governor, state agency leadership, and legislators. Additional Board members will be appointed to represent the areas that are eligible for R3 funding. These Board members will consist of elected officials, service providers, violence prevention experts, and people who have been directly impacted by incarceration.

### Do Board members get paid?

Board members are not eligible for compensation, except for reimbursement of reasonable expenses.

### How will the Board hold grantees accountable?

Grantees will be required to provide data and other information to the Board to ensure that grant funds are used effectively and efficiently.

### How much money does the R3 Board have to distribute?

The R3 program receives 25% of net tax revenue from adult-use cannabis and has been allocated $10 million for the 2020 fiscal year. Depending on the growth of the cannabis market, the R3 Board may distribute up to $125 million per year in the future.

### Updated July 17, 2020 (FINAL UPDATE)

<div class="faq-indent">

#### Will grantees have to limit services to persons living in the eligible census tracts or can they simply make those census tracts the focus of service delivery?

Programs must serve community residents within the eligible areas, but clients in neighboring census tracts should not be denied services.

#### It is difficult to formulate questions before the RFP is public. Will there be ongoing opportunities to seek information once the RFP is posted?

Yes. You may email questions on the NOFOs through until 11:59 p.m. on July 16, 2020.

Email questions regarding the Assessment and Planning NOFO to: [CJA.R3Planning@illinois.gov](CJA.R3Planning@illinois.gov)
Email questions regarding the Service Delivery NOFO to: [CJA.R3Service@illinois.gov](CJA.R3Service@illinois.gov)
Email general R3 program questions to: [Mitchell.Troup2@illinois.gov](Mitchell.Troup2@illinois.gov)
All substantive questions and responses will be posted at [https://r3.illinois.gov/faqs](/faqs).

#### Downstate civil legal aid organizations cover large geographic regions. For example, within the Prairie State Legal Services 36-county region, there are 160 locations in 23 counties identified as R3 zones. Can a single application include multiple zones? If we wanted to place designated staff in, let’s say, Kankakee, Rockford, Peoria, and Joliet would we need submit separate applications?

All zones fall into funding regions. Applicant organizations may propose to serve multiple zones as long as the zones are located within a single funding region. Applicant organizations proposing to serve zones in more than one funding region must submit separate applications for each region.

#### Our building is not directly in a zone but on the other side of the street from a zone. Would we be eligible to serve any client in our facility, or only clients who resided in the zone?

To be eligible for funding, an R3 program must be centered around an R3 zone. If your building is located just outside of an R3 zone and many of your clients are from that zone, you may provide services to any client who comes to your facility. However, you must demonstrate in your application that a significant portion of your client base will be from the R3 zone to be deemed eligible for R3 funding. In addition, any outreach activities, advertising, or marketing geared toward new clients should occur within an R3 zone.

#### In that case, would my agency be eligible for local preference points for being in an R3 zone?

No. Local preference points are only given to organizations within an R3 zone. However, your agency may qualify for local preference points if at least half of your organization’s employees live within an R3 zone, or if you are in a collaborative with other organizations and at least half of those organizations are within an R3 zone.

#### Will there be any assistance toward writing the grants for community assessments and planning, and service delivery programs?

Yes. ICJIA hosted three webinars on May 19, 20, and 21 to assist potential applicants. After these live webinars, the webinar recordings were posted on ICJIA’s YouTube channel:
Webinar #1

Applicants with limited experience in applying for state grants also are encouraged to take a grant technical assistance workshop. Workshops provide an overview of the state grant process and what it means to comply with the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA). GATA was created to ensure a coordinated, transparent process for efficient oversight of grant recipient selection and monitoring.

For more information or to register for a workshop, go to [icjia.illinois.gov/gata/technical-assistance](https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/technical-assistance).

#### What type of organizations can apply for R3 grants?

To be eligible for R3 grants, organizations must be based in or serve residents of eligible R3 areas. Organizations eligible to apply for this funding are nonprofit organizations, local units of government, faith-based organizations, businesses and community or neighborhood associations. All organizations must meet the minimum standards to receive state funds in order to be part of an application. More information on these requirements are at r3.illinois.gov/resources.

#### Is funding renewed annually for approved applicants or will they need to reapply?

Grant awards resulting from this opportunity will have a target period of performance of approximately 9 months, from September 2020 to June 30, 2021. Additional funding of up to 24 months may be awarded after the initial funding period based on program performance and availability of funds.

#### What are the determinants for R3 designated areas?

Areas were identified using community-level data on gun injury, child poverty, unemployment, and state prison commitments and returns, combined with Disproportionately Impacted Areas identified by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO).

#### How can people find out if the area their organizations provides services to is an R3 eligible zone?

View an interactive map of areas eligible for R3 Program grants at [r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](/eligibility). Type any address or municipality into the search bar. Addresses within the color-coded, shaded areas are eligible.

#### What options does my organization have if our application is rejected?

Unsuccessful applicants may request a formal appeal of the evaluation process via email and submitted within 14 calendar days after the date the grant award notice is published or receipt of a Funding Opportunity Declination Letter from ICJIA, whichever was received first. A debriefing may be requested for feedback using the evaluation and review criteria. Requests for debriefings must be made via email and submitted within 7 calendar days after receipt of notice.

#### Where can I find the R3 Notices of Funding Opportunity?

Access the R3 Notices of Funding Opportunity at [icjia.illinois.gov/gaga](https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata) or on the R3 website: [r3.illinois.gov]().

#### If you already receive state funding for your program, are you eligible to get funding for the same program through the R3 funding?

You may apply for R3 funding to expand programs supported with other state funds. R3 funds may not be used to supplant, or replace, other funds. Grants must be used to expand or enhance existing programs.

#### Can organizations apply for funding for services to currently incarcerated people who come from identified census tracts?

Yes, organizations may provide R3 services to individuals who are incarcerated but come from R3 zones.

</div>

### Questions and Answers from May 18, 2020 to May 21, 2020

<div class="faq-indent">

#### If our organization is headquartered outside of an R3 zone, but our service area is in an R3 zone, are we eligible? How do we find out what the R3 zones are?

Yes, you would be eligible to apply based on your service area being within an R3 zone. However, your application would not get local preference points based on your organization’s location. You can find the R3 zones by looking at the color-coded, shaded areas at the interactive map at [r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](/https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility).

#### If my police department is interested in this funding, but there are no R3 areas in our jurisdiction, would we be ineligible?

Only programs that serve R3 zones are eligible for this funding.

#### For the R3 Service Delivery NOFO, can we apply for more than one of the program priorities?

Yes. All R3 programs must address at least one of the R3 Program Priorities. Applicants may address more than one, or all five, as well. It is up to the applicant to decide how many of the program priorities should be addressed by the proposed program.

#### If our program addresses more than one of the program priorities, do we need to submit a separate application for each one?

No. You only need to submit one application, but your program narrative should include information about which of the program priorities your program will address and explain the program design for how each of these priorities will be addressed.

#### How do you define a program being “in” an R3 zone if programs are offered virtually?

Programs should be designed to serve residents of an R3 zone. If programs can be offered virtually, it should be intended to serve residents of R3 zones, should be geared towards the needs of R3 zone communities, and the focus of advertising and marketing to attract clients should be on the R3 zone.

#### Our organization is in three R3 zones, but the county jail that we serve is not. Are we not able to focus on that program?

R3 services may be provided to residents of R3 zones that are currently incarcerated if the services provided are focused on residents returning from prison or jail to their communities.

#### Is one application structure (single organization or collaborative) preferred over the other?

There are no points attributed to either application structure. Applicants should make their own decisions whether to apply on their own or as part of a collaborative based on which best serves their proposed program.

#### If we provide programming in a school, would the schools need to sign MOUs? Or is this only required for the organizations providing services?

For the application, only organizations applying together as part of a collaborative would need to sign MOUs indicating their joint agreement to be part of the proposed project described in the application. If the program in the application was granted funding, it may be determined that other MOUs would be needed for proper execution of program activities, but these would not be required at the point of application.

#### GATA qualification is a lengthy process. If one agency in a collaborative application has the pre-qualification requirements completed, can we move forward while the other agency is waiting for approval?

For collaborative applications, only the responsible applicant would need to have completed all of the GATA requirements by the time of application. If others have applied for a DUNS number, SAM.gov account, and other qualifiers they can be included in the application. However, they would not be able to be active as part of the project until they meet these requirements, so they would need to meet these requirements by the time they are ready to begin the program.

#### Can units of government apply as lead on a collaborative of nonprofits without selecting the subgrantee partners through a competitive bidding process (RFP)?

Yes. If a collaborative application is made, all members of the collaborative are identified in the application, and the responsible applicant does not need to choose subgrantees through a competitive bidding process. However, if additional partners that are not identified in the initial application are added, these partners would need to go through such a process.

#### Can you define or give examples of the R3 Program Priorities?

Additional information about each of the five program priorities are included in Appendix A of each NOFO, at the very end of the NOFO instructions. We recommend reviewing this material for more information on each Program Priority.

#### Can one organization submit two separate grants for the same program priority if we have two programs that both fall under the same priority?

Only one application for each NOFO can be submitted per applicant in any given funding region. If you want to perform two different program activities, but both can be incorporated into the same program and same application, you may do so. Alternatively, if the two programs fall into separate funding regions, an applicant may submit one application per funding region. In either case, one applicant should only submit one application per NOFO per funding region.

#### Are the program priorities described in the application documents?

Yes; the program priorities are explained in the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) instructions. Additional information about each of the five program priorities are included in Appendix A of each NOFO, at the very end of the NOFO instructions. We recommend reviewing this material for more information on each Program Priority.

#### How should you apply if you are serving more than one community?

If all of the R3 zones your proposed program will serve are within one funding region, you may apply under one application. If your program would span across multiple funding regions, you would need to submit separate applications for each funding region within which your program would operate.

#### Are we allowed to request funds to purchase and renovate properties to house formerly incarcerated individuals?

No, capital expenditures are an unallowable expense for these grant funds, so you would not be able to include these costs in the budget for the program.

#### What is the maximum dollar amount an organization can apply for?

Maximum (and minimum) dollar amounts for an application are based on the type of NOFO applied for (Assessment and Planning or Service Delivery) and on the proposed program’s funding region. Award ranges are shown on the map at [r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](/eligibility). Click on an R3 zone within the funding regions, or see Question 1 of the Program Narrative in each NOFO.

#### Are faith-based organizations eligible to receive funds under this program?

Yes, as long as the organization also meets the criteria to receive state funds listed in the NOFO. Nonprofit organizations, local units of government, businesses, and community or neighborhood associations are also eligible as long as they meet the criteria to receive state funding. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

#### Are you eligible to apply for this opportunity if you are a current ICJIA grant recipient?

Yes, your receipt of another grant does not disqualify you from this grant opportunity.

#### Only certain parts of our area seem to be in the eligible sections. If our location is in a section that is not an R3 zone, but all of the participants of the program will be from areas that are eligible, are we still allowed to apply for R3? Or would our physical location of the program need to be in a colored/eligible area? Our program location is two blocks from a priority area based on the map.

To be eligible for funding, an R3 program must be centered around an R3 zone. If your building is located just outside of an R3 zone and many (or all) of your clients are from that zone, you may provide services to any client who comes to your facility. However, you must demonstrate in your application that a significant portion of your client base will be from the R3 zone to be deemed eligible for R3 funding. In addition, any outreach activities, advertising, or marketing geared toward new clients should occur within an R3 zone.

#### If you are an agency that relies heavily on volunteers, would there be local preference points for those who reside in the R3 zones as they are the ones working most with clients?

Unfortunately, the local preference points based on employee residence only allow for local preference points if at least half of the employees of an organization reside in an R3 zone.

#### What is GATA?

GATA, or the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act, is a law that governs how grants are administered in the State of Illinois. The guidelines established by GATA determine who is eligible to receive grants, how grant funds are disbursed, what costs are allowable, and more. The GATA Grantee Portal is a system that helps applicants determine if they are in compliance with GATA requirements and therefore able to apply for funding through the state.

#### Can a single organization submit an application for both planning and direct services?

Yes, if an applicant believes that their community needs an assessment and planning process as well as immediate service delivery, the applicant can submit an application to each NOFO. However, keep in mind that since the Assessment and Planning NOFO and Service Delivery NOFO are different funding opportunities, the applicant would need to submit a separate application under each NOFO in order to be considered. One application cannot include both planning and service delivery program proposals.

#### Will the PowerPoint slides from the webinars be posted publicly?

Yes. In addition to the R3 webinars being made available on ICJIA’s YouTube channel, a PDF of the PowerPoint slides will be available at [r3.illinois.gov/resources](/resources).

#### How long does this grant last?

The first year’s performance period is approximately 9 months. It is estimated to begin late September or early October and will last through June 30, 2021.

#### While the first grant is 9 months, can we assume that successful grantees will continue to receive a second year of funding? It is a challenge to hire professionals for a 9-month job.

Applicants that are granted funding by submitting a successful application to this NOFO may be granted up to two additional years of funding after the first year, subject to continued appropriation of the funds, availability of the funds, and acceptable program performance. We intend to continue these grants if we are able to do so, but we cannot guarantee at this time that the grants will be continued.

#### Does my agency need to be a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in order to apply?

No. 501(c)(3) status is not a requirement. Eligible applicants include nonprofit organizations, local units of government, faith-based organizations, businesses, or other community or neighborhood organizations. Applicants must meet the basic criteria to be eligible to receive state funds. These criteria are: 1.) a DUNS number; 2.) a SAM.gov account; 3.) a Grants.gov account; 4.) Good standing with the IL Secretary of State; 5.) not on the State No-Pay List. In addition, single organization applicants or responsible applicants submitting applications on behalf of a collaborative will need an account in the State of Illinois GATA Grantee Portal.

#### Are there any upfront costs that we must have for starting up?

This will depend on the applicant organization and the proposed program. It is likely that organizations will have some upfront costs to start up a new program once grant agreements are finalized and services begin.

#### When do payments begin?

Selected grantees can begin their programs as soon as their grant agreements are signed. Organizations can request reimbursement on a monthly basis following that time. UPDATE: Grantees can apply to receive advances after the agreements are executed.

#### Our organization does not have a brick and mortar “location.” We consider our locations the schools that we serve out of. The mailing address we use is actually a UPS mail box. So in this case, should we use our school’s address for the location to determine eligibility and local preference points?

Since the program operates out of the school, you should use the school’s address to determine if you operate in an R3 zone and thus if you are eligible for these funds. However, you should use the mailing address of your organization when determining if your organization is eligible for local preference points.

#### Is it possible to get the GATA requirements completed by the due date of July 20, 2020?

Yes, all interested organizations should be able to complete the requirements before the due date. However, if you need to complete some steps, we suggest starting as soon as possible to ensure that you are eligible by the time you apply.

#### Some state grants are for a short time frame, and then limit funds for the second year to the same amount of funds as for the short period. Is that likely with these funds?

Continued funds for this program after the first year will be dependent on appropriation, availability of funds, and program performance of grantees. We hope to have more funds, so that existing grantees can maintain or possibly expand their programs, and to allow opportunities for new applicants. However, we cannot predict this with certainty at this time.

#### My organization does not have a building in an eligible R3 zone, but we do have a PO box in the community where we meet. Do we qualify?

As long as services are offered in an R3 zone, your organization may be eligible to apply. You do not need to have a building in that zone.

#### Will there be any point considerations for matching funds or in-kind contributions?

No. There are no points attributed to matching funds or in-kind contributions in the application scoring process.

#### Do we need to submit a separate application for each R3 zone that we plan to address?

If all of the R3 zones in your service area are in the same funding region, then you can combine them all into a single application. If the R3 zones are in different funding regions, you should submit a separate application for each funding region.

#### Can we apply for both as a single entity and with a collaboration for different areas?

You can submit separate applications as a single organization and with a collaborative as long as the applications are submitted in different funding regions and/or for different NOFOs. You cannot submit two applications for the same NOFO within the same funding region, even if one is with a collaborative and one is not.

#### How much funding is available?

While the final amount available will depend on the amount appropriated and the amount available in the trust fund for this program, we are estimating a total of $31.5 million in grant funds for this program ($3.15 million for Assessment and Planning, and \$28.35 million for Service Delivery).

#### Are the minimum and maximum amounts listed on the map and in the Program Narrative per application or per region?

The award ranges listed in the map and in the Program Narrative are minimum and maximum amounts per application.

#### Can we submit multiple applications if we work with multiple regions?

Yes, organizations can submit multiple applications as long as the applications are submitted in different funding regions. Organizations cannot submit more than one application within one funding region for the same NOFO. Keep in mind that there may be many R3 zones within a single funding region; if the applicant wants to work with multiple R3 zones in the same funding region, they should only submit one application for that project.

#### How are the high-need areas identified? Are they color-coded a specific color? Are some colors more high-need than others?

High need areas can be identified by an asterisk (\*) after the R3 Zone ID in the pop-up box that appears when you click on a color-coded, shaded area on the map at [r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](/eligibility). The different colors are to identify the different funding regions, so color differences do not indicate if an area is high-need or not.

#### Can the responsible applicant submit more than one application on behalf of collaboratives?

A responsible applicant can only be a part of one application per NOFO per funding region, even a collaborative application. They could submit separate applications for different funding region, but not within one region.

#### Can an organization submit one application that has both assessment/planning and service delivery program activities?

No. The Assessment and Planning NOFO and the Service Delivery NOFO are completely separate funding opportunities. They have different funding ranges, different Program Narratives, and different criteria. If an organization is interested in applying for both, the applicant would need to submit one application for each NOFO.

#### Are individual correctional facilities eligible to be lead organizations in applying for a grant?

Yes, as long as they meet the other eligibility requirements to receive state funds. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

#### Does civil legal aid include removing barriers to employment and providing assistance with license suspensions, etc? For ‘youth development,’ up to what age would one be considered ‘youth?’ Does ‘reentry’ mean helping people with criminal records, who might not have been incarcerated or who were incarcerated a long time ago?

The categories of the five R3 Program Priorities are not meant to be restrictive. If you would like more information on each program priority, it is recommended that you view the full NOFO and look at Appendix A at the end for more information. It will be up to the applicant to fully explain in their program narrative what the design of their proposed program would be and how their proposed program fits with at least one R3 Program Priority.

#### How many grants will be given per funding region?

This is not known, since it will depend on how many applications are selected and what amounts are requested in those applications. However, the program is set up so that we have the ability to fund more than one grant per funding region for each NOFO.

#### Can civil legal aid providers apply to cover just one area of work (i.e. domestic violence or housing) but not all areas?

The scope of the program is up to the applicant to define and to explain in the program narrative, as long as it addresses an R3 Program Priority. Applicants should explain what services are being provided and why these services (and not others that could be provided) may be needed in the service area.

#### Can a for-profit corporation submit an application as a single applicant or a collaborative lead?

Yes, if the corporation satisfies all of the eligibility requirements, including having a GATA Grantee Portal account, it can submit an application either as a single applicant organization or as a responsible applicant on behalf of a collaborative.

#### If the proposed start date for grants is September, does this mean that those grants approved for funding would not receive funds until that time?

Currently, grants are operating via a reimbursement basis. As such, it means that grants would not receive funds until after the start date for programs. If this changes, and advance payment is approved, we will post an update to inform applicants of this change.

UPDATE: Successful applicants will be able to request advances. More information will be provided to grantees regarding how to qualify for these advances.

#### When will FAQ updates be posted?

Updates to the questions and answers documents will be posted on Fridays, and we will update the document with any new questions received in the previous week, as well as answers to those questions.

#### Can an organization apply as a single organization and also apply with a collaborative with another organization as lead in different or same regions?

This would be possible if the two applications were in different regions, but not within the same region.

#### Is there somewhere we can go to view already-completed grant applications?

Unfortunately, we do not have the ability to post completed grant applications as examples. Since this is a new program, and this is the first round of applications for the program, there are no previously-approved applications that could be shared as examples. Other resources may have examples of generic grant application templates, but we cannot assist applicants in this area.

#### The NOFO packet describes a purpose of the grant to promote infrastructure. Could this be used for roadwork or infrastructure of the city?

No, the meaning in this context is to promote the networks of community organizations to provide support to residents. Capital expenditures such as roadwork or public works projects would not be allowable costs or allowable projects for these NOFOs.

#### Is the dollar amount of the grant range annual or for the cumulative 36-month project period?

The grant ranges are estimates for the first year’s project period.

#### What is the average or typical time frame for monthly invoices or financials submitted?

Reimbursements can take some time to process from receipt of the reimbursement request until the reimbursement is issued to the grantee. While we cannot predict exactly how long this takes, it can be anywhere from one to two months. We are exploring ways to reduce this wait time, and if any updates to this occur, we will post an update to inform applicants.

#### If the first grant period is nine months, do we request 12 months of expenses or do we prorate the requested amount to nine months?

Applicants should request the amount they estimate that they will need for the nine-month project period, including any start-up expenses that might be necessary.

#### Will reimbursement be by check or electronic?

Most reimbursements are via direct deposit, but grantees need to ensure that the Comptroller’s Office has the correct information (including payment method and details). If an organization is a new grantee, they will need to complete forms for the Comptroller’s Office containing this information.

#### To receive local preference points based on employee local residence, would half of the employees need to live in the same R3 zone we are applying for? Or can they live in nearby zones?

They could live in nearby zones, as long as they are also R3 zones.

#### If we are using the de minimis 10% indirect cost rate, is that 10% of our direct costs?

The de minimis indirect cost rate is 10% of your Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) base. The MTDC base excludes certain costs, such as occupancy and subawards over \$25,000. For more information on indirect costs, you can view the Indirect Cost recording on ICJIA’s YouTube channel.

#### Can you address supplanting? Does it refer to all funds or just government funds?

Supplanting means using funds from one grant (i.e. the R3 grant) to take the place of other grant funds in an existing program so that other funds can be used for other purposes. This refers to government funds, so R3 funding should not be used to supplant other state funding. Applicants for R3 funds should seek to provide new programs, or to expand or enhance existing programs, rather than simply use these funds to supplant others. Note that it is not considered supplanting if the funds being replaced have been discontinued, only if the funds are still available for use in the program but instead are put to a different use because of the availability of the R3 funding.

#### Can collaborations exist across R3 areas?

Yes. We encourage collaborations (both formal and informal) within and across R3 areas. Collaborative applications can cover multiple R3 areas as long as they are within the same funding region. However, grantees are also encouraged to work together informally even if they are not members of the same collaborative, and these informal collaborations are not bound by the R3 funding regions.

#### We are a county agency and therefore serve residents of the entire county. Are we allowed to service people that reside outside of an R3 zone in our county?

To be eligible for funding, an R3 program must be centered around an R3 zone. If your county contains one or more R3 zones and many of your clients are from those zones, you may provide services to any client who comes to your facility. However, you must demonstrate in your application that a significant portion of your client base will be from the R3 zone to be deemed eligible for R3 funding. In addition, any outreach activities, advertising, or marketing geared toward new clients should occur within an R3 zone.

#### If an organization has multiple locations, if one is in an R3 zone would our organization still qualify for funding/additional points?

The organization may be eligible for funding if the proposed service area is the R3 zone. However, organizations with multiple locations should use the primary address of their organization, not branch addresses, when applying local preference points.

#### What is the anticipated ‘average’ award size? What is the anticipated number of awards?

This is not known, since it will depend on how many applications are selected and what amounts are requested in those applications.

#### Could an organization apply as a single applicant to provide direct services in an area and then also consult with another organization that would also provide direct services in the area by expensing dollars for that consultant in the budget instead of doing a collaborative application?

This would be allowable, but it would be up to each applicant to determine if this approach is the best way to operate their programs.

#### I have two companies—one for-profit, and one non-profit. Do I apply as a single applicant or a collaborative?

We cannot give advice on how best to apply. Either the for-profit or non-profit could be eligible to apply as either a single applicant or as the responsible applicant of a collaborative, assuming that both meet the eligibility requirements.

#### Who are the people who will be reviewing and scoring the applications?

The application reviewers will be individuals from R3 zones who have experience in at least one of the five R3 Program Priorities.

#### If there are multiple R3 zones in a region, will all of those R3 zones be competing for the regional funding amount?

Strictly speaking, the R3 zones do not compete—rather, organizations proposing programs in those zones will be competing for the funding. However, the total funding amount for each funding region will be available to any applicant in that region, so if there are multiple R3 zones in a region, the resulting program funds may be split across those zones based on the applications that are selected for funding.

#### Are currently operating dispensaries allowed to apply?

If they satisfy all of the eligibility requirements to apply, there is nothing in the grant requirements barring dispensaries from applying for this funding. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

The grant agreement requires grantees to comply with all provisions of the Illinois Drug-Free Workplace Act, 30 ILCS 580/3, which prohibits the manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a controlled substance at the place where services are being performed. Therefore, dispensaries are prohibited from accepting a grant for work at the dispensary or any place where cannabis is being manufactured, distributed, dispensed, or possessed. The dispensary would be eligible to apply as long as it remains in compliance with this Act.

#### Are K-12 schools eligible to apply? Can post-secondary schools apply?

If they satisfy all of the eligibility requirements to apply, there is nothing in the grant requirements barring schools from applying for this funding. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

#### Are nonprofit hospital systems eligible to apply?

If they satisfy all of the eligibility requirements to apply, there is nothing in the grant requirements barring hospital systems from applying for this funding. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

#### We are already getting approached to join into collaborations for R3. We love collaborative projects but there can be issues when we get into the details. One detail issue for legal aid is sharing confidential client information with an agency that may be taking a lead role. In some grants, they allow the legal services reporting to remain independent of the other data. This means that there may be a client served by legal services that is also served with other project services but they do not demand the legal services to be part of an “unduplicated” count. Before we go too far down the road on collaborations it will be important to know the data reporting requirements. Is this something that you will be sharing on the webinars? If not, is this something ICJIA can consider soon? The other strategy is for our organization to do an independent application but plan activities in coordination with other who will provide other types of supportive services.

The grant agreement that will be executed between ICJIA and successful NOFO applicants states that the grantee (and sub-grantee in sub-grants) must comply with all applicable confidentiality laws. The agreement also states that grantee must do periodic reporting and participate in any evaluation project. To the extent there is any conflict between those mandates, you have to protect confidentiality. Also, please note that reporting and evaluation for our grants is based on aggregate numbers and not client personal information, which can also be redacted. For program reporting, ICJIA is interested in the numbers of services provided in terms of the goals and objectives identified in the program design.

#### Are high need areas identified in the R3 Table at [r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility) given priority for funding?

The high need areas identified in the table and identified by an asterisk on the map will receive additional points in the application review, but they will still be evaluated based on their total scores, as are all applications for the grant opportunity.

#### Can a regional organization submit an Assessment and Planning grant and a Service grant for the same region but different Census Tracts?

Yes. An organization can submit both an application for an Assessment and Planning program and an application for a Service Delivery program. The two applications are separate, so they do not need to apply to the same R3 zone.

#### Are units of government eligible?

If they satisfy all of the eligibility requirements to apply, there is nothing in the grant requirements barring units of government from applying for this funding. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

#### Is there a recording of the R3 Community Engagement Call that can be accessed online?

The link for the recording of the R3 Community Engagement Call is:
[https://youtu.be/VhK1F2vhGqc](https://youtu.be/VhK1F2vhGqc)

#### Is there a list of certified state grant writers that can help me complete an application?

We do not maintain a list of grant writers. Applicants are able to identify their own grant writers if they would like assistance in completing the application. ICJIA also recommends that applicants take advantage of the technical assistance sessions if they need assistance in becoming eligible for grants or applying for grant opportunities. For more information or to register for a workshop, go to [icjia.illinois.gov/gata/technical-assistance](https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/technical-assistance).

#### Can an organization join several collaborative applications for Service Delivery?

An organization can only be a party to one application, whether as a single organization or part of a collaborative, per NOFO per funding region. If the applications are within different funding regions, the organization could join different applications, but any organization could only be on one application per funding region within the Service Delivery NOFO.

#### Can this be used for Drug Court? Can it pay for a Drug Court Officer’s salary and benefits? Can it pay for drug testing probation clients? Can it pay for Drug Court rewards and incentives? Can it pay for Drug Court treatment/salary and benefits of a Drug Court Counselor?

The R3 program supports services in five different program priorities (civil legal aid, economic development, reentry, violence prevention, and youth development). For a program to be eligible to receive R3 funds, it must address at least one of those program priorities. It is an applicant’s responsibility to identify in the application how the proposed program addresses the chosen program priority or priorities.

I do not know all of the details of your drug court program, so I cannot specify one way or another whether the program would fit this requirement. However, you should consider whether the services provided under this program are services that focus on assisting community members rather than primarily supporting a government body’s operation. If your program provides needed services to community members in the five program priorities listed above, it could potentially be eligible. For example, it is unlikely that these funds can support operational costs of the drug court, costs of drug court officers, or costs of drug testing; but the funds may be able to support drug counselors, substance abuse treatment programs, or similar costs if they are related to one of the five R3 program priorities. If you choose to submit an application, it will then be evaluated by application reviewers who will consider the overall application, including the justification for the program design, and score the application according to the criteria in the NOFO.

#### Can a for profit organization economic development project for a full service live music venue that has a non profit component for music and drama programming for children-can this business apply? It does not look specifically exclude businesses but I just wanted to check?

For-profit businesses are eligible applicants to this grant opportunity if they satisfy all of the eligibility requirements to receive state funds. Businesses are not excluded from eligibility under this opportunity.

#### Each of the R3 zones within a funding region seem to have the same grant range. Because we are required to submit one application per region, if we are proposing to serve multiple zones with that region, are those ranges applicable to the full application or to each zone within the application?

The funding ranges are applicable to the application, not to the zones to be served. Therefore, if you intend to serve multiple R3 zones within a region, your application would not be able to exceed the stated maximum award amount, regardless of the number of R3 zones in your service area.

#### I'm interested in submitting a proposal for a R3 service grant but my proposal would include the creation of hygiene kits for local residents, which would include hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. In reading the Service Delivery Grant Instructions - Prohibited Uses: "implementation of a new program involving the use of chemicals" is listed. Would sanitizer and disinfectant wipes fall under the category of chemicals?

This prohibition does not cover the use of basic cleaning supplies. Hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, or other generally-available cleaning or hygiene items would be allowable costs under this NOFO. It is the applicant’s responsibility to explain in the Program Narrative how these costs are reasonable and support the proposed program.

#### Can a unit of government be a collaborative member (not a lead applicant) on multiple service delivery applications within a funding area? Specifically, we’re wondering if Cook County could be a partner on more than one application.

No. A single entity or organization (including a unit of government) can only be party to one application within a specific funding area, even if the entity is a member of the collaborative rather than the responsible applicant.

#### Is the expectation that all collaborative members would be receiving funding? Or not necessarily? Specifically, I’m wondering if our organization is a supporting partner but not seeking any funding via the grant, would we still qualify as a collaborative member for application purposes?

It is the expectation that all collaborative members will be receiving funding if the application is selected for funding. If your organization would like to support a collaborative application but does not seek funding via the grant, you may submit a letter of support, and the application may describe your role in the project, but you would not be considered part of the collaborative for application purposes.

#### Is this grant program intended to focus on gun violence, or should the term "violence" be considered more broadly? My organization focuses on gender based violence, and the NOFO is a little vague as to what type of violence is being prioritized by this funding.

While gun violence is definitely a major concern for this program, ‘violence prevention’ can be considered more broadly than just gun violence. The categories of the five R3 Program Priorities are not meant to be overly restrictive; we want organizations and communities to have the flexibility to focus on the needs that are most salient in their community. It will be up to the applicant to fully explain in their program narrative what the design of their proposed program would be and how their proposed program fits with at least one R3 Program Priority. Thus, if you can provide a good explanation in your statement of need for addressing a different type of violence, that explanation will be considered in reviewing your application. If you would like more information on each program priority, it is recommended that you view the full NOFO and look at Appendix A at the end for more information.

### Questions and Answers from May 22, 2020 to May 28, 2020

<div class="faq-indent">

#### Are cannabis businesses eligible to receive grant funding under the R3 Program, or is the cannabis industry excluded from eligibility?

If they satisfy all of the eligibility requirements to apply, there is nothing in the grant requirements barring cannabis businesses from applying for this funding. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

The grant agreement requires grantees to comply with all provisions of the Illinois Drug-Free Workplace Act, 30 ILCS 580/3, which prohibits the manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a controlled substance at the place where services are being performed. Therefore, dispensaries are prohibited from accepting a grant for work at the dispensary or any place where cannabis is being manufactured, distributed, dispensed, or possessed. The dispensary would be eligible to apply as long as it remains in compliance with this Act.

#### Could a grantee re-grant the funds via an RFP process to subgrantees?

Grantees may use this funding for subcontracts or subawards to other entities. However, the purpose and roles of the anticipated subcontracts or subawards should be made clear in the program design and will be considered in the review of the application. Subawards, and most subcontracts (depending on the amount of the contract and extent of the work) must be approved by ICJIA prior to any costs being incurred.

#### Will there be another NOFO next year? Or is this a one-time NOFO?

Applicants that are granted funding though this NOFO may be granted up to two additional years of funding after the first year, subject to continued appropriation of the funds, availability of the funds, and acceptable program performance. ICJIA intends to continue this program, with new NOFOs, for as long as grant funding is available.

#### Is the City of Chicago eligible to apply?

Yes, local units of government, including the City of Chicago, may apply under this NOFO assuming they satisfy all eligibility requirements. As with all applications, they would need to also submit an eligible program design that fits with the R3 program requirements.

#### Would research projects be allowed under the assessment/planning grant?

Research projects may be performed as part of an assessment and planning grant, if the applicant determines that the research project is necessary to the assessment proposed in the application. The applicant would need to explain in detail the need for the research project as well as how the research project will be carried out.

##### I heard from someone that the materials state that only one grantee will be approved per region. That seemed incorrect because there are so many potential services. I was not sure if they were referencing the language in the application that states: “What region will your program serve? Refer to the map of R3 zones to find the region and select ONE. Only one application per region may be submitted. Separate applications must be submitted for each region served by your proposed program. Funding amounts are based on the population that lives in R3 zones within each region.” I am assuming that this means an independent organization can only submit one application in each region. Will ICJIA fund more than one applicant within a region?

Yes, ICJIA will fund more than one applicant per region. Organizations may only submit one application or be a collaborator in one application per region.

ICJIA expects to support many applicants/programs in each funding region, under each NOFO. Funding caps have been established to ensure at least two grantees for each type of NOFO will be funded in each region. The total number of programs funded will depend on how many applications are selected by the reviewers and how much funding is requested.

#### Is the R3 Assessment and Planning grant strictly designed to plan a brand new program and then sites are expected to utilize another funding source to implement and run the program, or can funds be used to implement and run a brand new program after the planning process has been completed?

The Assessment and Planning grant is designed to fund a process to determine what services are needed in a community and what resources are available, and to prepare a community plan for providing services in the community. Developing a new program is not required.

Funds under this grant opportunity cannot be used to implement the program of services. However, applicants who carry out an assessment and planning process may apply for Service Delivery funding under this or another NOFO.

#### If we are providing services to prisoners and detainees who are transitioning out, is the R3 zone where the prison is located or where the client is going to live?

The R3 program is intended to serve residents of R3 zones, so the relevant zones for these services would be the zones where the client resides or will reside upon leaving the facility.

#### On the “Service Delivery Program Narrative” document, question #4 states: Only organizations proposing to carry out an assessment and planning process for designated R3 zones are eligible for this funding. Please identify the zone(s) that will be covered by this assessment and planning process by listing the 4-digit “R3 Zone IDs” from this map of the R3 zones. As this is the Service Delivery RFP, and not the Assessment and Planning RFP, can you please confirm whether Service Delivery applicants must also complete an assessment and planning process as part of the Service Delivery grant?

Service Delivery granttes are not required to complete an assessment and planning process. The Service Delivery Program Narrative should read: “Only organizations proposing to provide services for designated R3 zones are eligible for this funding. Please identify the zone(s) that will be covered by this proposed service delivery by listing the 4-digit “R3 Zone IDs” from this map of the R3 zones.” A revised Program Narrative Document will be posted shortly.

To clarify, Service Delivery applicants are not required to complete an assessment and planning process as part of the Service Delivery grant.

#### Understanding that applicants are not to delete any template questions or document formatting, are applicants able to delete the instructions on page 1, the note for questions #14 and #15, the Budget Detail and Narrative description, and the Goals, Objectives and Performance Measures description?

Yes, instructions and notes within the Program Narrative can be removed prior to submission.

#### I have a question about clients who change location. We provide legal aid to prisoners as they transition back into the community. This often means helping them find suitable housing. If the housing is outside of the R3 zone, would we still be able to serve that client?

If the client was eligible for R3 services when you began providing those services, and then the client moved outside of an R3 zone, you can continue providing those same services and follow-up to those services to the existing client.

#### I’m hoping you can help me with a question regarding reporting requirements. I see a brief description on page 24 of the NOFO: “Recipients must submit monthly financial reports, quarterly program progress reports, final financial and progress reports, and, if applicable, an annual audit report in accordance with the 2 CFR Part 200 Uniform Requirements. Future awards and fund drawdowns may be withheld if reports are delinquent.” Are you planning to use a template for these reports? Or a database to collect data? My team is surveying staffing needs in connection with the reporting, so I am looking to get a sense of the complexity of reports.

Grantees will receive an Excel template to complete monthly financial reports and a Word template to complete quarterly program progress reports. Each grantee will be assigned to a grant monitor who can provide assistance, as needed.

#### Is there a maximum grant amount for which we can apply?

Maximum (and minimum) dollar amounts for an application are based on the type of NOFO applied for (Assessment and Planning or Service Delivery) and on the proposed program’s funding region. Award ranges are shown on the map at [https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility). Click on an R3 zone within the funding regions, or see Question 1 of the Program Narrative in each NOFO.

#### I can’t locate previous questions and answers. I’ve checked the ICJIA site and clicked on questions—it just tells you where to ask questions. Can you tell me how to access the answers to my question and other questions people have asked?

Questions and answers may be found at [https://r3.illinois.gov/faqs](https://r3.illinois.gov/faqs). They are also posted on the funding pages for each NOFO at [https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/funding](https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/funding).

#### My organization may not have the cash flow to start up our program and pay our staff while we await reimbursement. Is it possible to receive advance payments?

Grantees are able to request advance payment, subject to ICJIA policy. Grantees requesting advances must demonstrate need, itemize expected costs, and comply with Illinois Administrative Code regarding advance payments located at [http://ilga.gov/commission/JCAR/admincode/044/044070000B01200R.html](http://ilga.gov/commission/JCAR/admincode/044/044070000B01200R.html).

</div>

### Questions and Answers from May 29, 2020 to June 4, 2020

<div class="faq-indent">

#### If my county is not listed as an R3 zone, can it still apply for funding? Did I do something (or neglect to do something) to make my county ineligible?

Counties that do not contain R3 zones are not eligible for R3 funds. R3 zones were selected based on a number of factors to identify areas disproportionately harmed by violence, economic disinvestment, and the war on drugs. Data used to identify these areas can be found here [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources](https://r3.illinois.gov/resources) under “Analysis.” 

Eligibility was determined based only on these data and not on any action (or inaction) taken by any county or other unit of government.

#### If our assessment and planning project includes a research project, would the research project be subject to IRB approval in the same way it would for a federal grant, or are state guidelines less restrictive?

Federal IRB procedures and requirements will apply under this NOFO. 

#### An applicant can only file one application within a region (for example the Collar County region).  We have 4 offices within in the region including Kankakee, Joliet, Waukegan, and West Chicago.  The application form is set up to assume a single location including a specific zip code.  How can one complete the application when the applicant is planning to serve several communities within a zone or region?

Only your organization’s primary address should be entered for local preference purposes on the Program Narrative and the Uniform Grant Application. 

Applicant proposing to serve several communities within a zone or region need only to describe in the Program Narrative what communities will be served. 

#### My organization would like to submit an application for Service Delivery as a responsible applicant, and in the application we would specify a partnership with a specific service provider. Is a competitive subcontract process required, or could funds be awarded directly to the provider specified in our application? Is it required that we would provide direct services, or could we provide administrative/policy/other forms of support to the direct service provider named in the application?

Partners included as a member of a collaborative application submitted by your organization, will not be required to enter into competitive subcontract process. Both the responsible organization and collaborative members are considered applicants. Partners that are not included as a member of a collaborative in an application may be required to submit to a competitive subcontract process per ICJIA’s routine subcontract/subaward approval policy.

It is acceptable for collaborative members to perform different roles in the collaborative. For example, one member could provide administrative support, while others perform direct services. Descriptions of these roles should be incorporated into memorandums of understanding between collaborative members and must be explained and justified at the appropriate points in the Program Narrative. Divisions of labor and responsibility within collaboratives should reflect values of equity, justice, and opportunity.

#### If we are the responsible applicant and collaborate with another organization on an R3 Service Delivery program, can we also submit another Service Delivery application on our own as a single organization applicant? Either for both programs to run at the same time in collaboration or possibly have one start at a later date? Could both programs be funded?

No. Single entities or organizations may only be party to one application within a specific funding area in each NOFO category. Only one applications may be submitted or funded. 

#### When we ask questions regarding R3 grant funding, will the response be sent to our email address or do we have to look for it on the Q&A document?

ICJIA responds to emailed questions directly to sender. They also are posted here [https://r3.illinois.gov/faqs](https://r3.illinois.gov/faqs), under R3 NOFO Questions and Answers.

#### During one of the webinars it was stated that businesses can not submit a grant application individually - that they must apply as part of a collaboration.  However, it's not stated in the NOFO instructions document.  Can you confirm that businesses must apply for these grants as part of a collaboration in order to be considered?

Businesses can apply as either a single organization or as a member or responsible applicant of a collaborative as long as they satisfy all eligibility requirements. 

#### If an agency is part of a collaborative grant application, then would each of the agencies be considered a subcontract/subaward with the lead agency and submit a subcontract budget as part of the program budget submitted with the application? For each subcontract, can they include IDC costs per their negotiated agreement with HHS or the state?

Yes, members of collaborative applications will be subgrantees of the responsible applicant organization. Applicants are not required to submit all subaward budgets at the time of application but may specify how funds will be distributed and used in Budget or Program Narrative documents. Subawards may include indirect costs if allowable under state and/or federal regulations.

#### Can applicants propose a program that serves all of the R3 zones within a funding region?

Yes.

#### We are pre-qualified in GATA but as a new organization still in our first year, we would not perform well in the ICQ. Would this impede our performance on the application? Should we look for a submitting partner who has a longer track record?

The ICQ is not a factor in the scoring of applications. If an applicant is successful in the application process and is awarded funds, ICJIA may use the ICQ to develop grant conditions to ensure that state funds are appropriately managed. If you fear the results of the ICQ may impose additional requirements on your organization, consider one of these options:

•	Form a collaborative with a partner who can act as a fiscal agent for administrative functions.
•	Identify a fiscal agent after the grant is awarded.

An R3 program goal is to increase opportunity and build capacity for community organizations. Organizations that have valuable experience and ideas on how to provide needed services will not be excluded based on ICQ results. The most important component of a successful application will be how well the proposed program is conceived and explained in the Program Narrative portion of the application. 

Application reviewers will be cognizant of R3 program values and score applications based on the NOFO and Program Narrative criteria, not on external factors. Organizations with knowledge of the local community, experience in providing community services, and a sound program design will be competitive for this funding opportunity, regardless of external factors.

#### May we please have example letters of commitment/memorandums of understanding? The link to examples on the website does not currently lead to any examples.

Click here for examples of a letter of commitment and memorandum of understanding: [https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fysb/mou_508.pdf](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fysb/mou_508.pdf). 

#### Does the responsible applicant have to submit its own letter of commitment in addition to submitting the letters of commitment(s) from the partner(s) in the collaboration?

No, only collaborative members must submit letters of commitment/memorandums of understanding (MOUs). MOUs show that all members included in a collaborative application agree to participate in the proposed project. However, responsible applicants also may choose to submit an MOU on their own or upon request of other members of the collaborative.

#### We are working on our application for the R3 Service Delivery Grant and want to use part of the funding to supplement our existing program and part of the funding to create and begin running a new program. Is it possible for one implementing agency to submit two applications in the event we only qualify for one, or should we submit one application with both programs included? Can we receive partial funding for what our budget asks, or is the application either accepted or rejected in full?

An organization may only submit (or be a part of) one application per funding region per NOFO. Applicants may include proposals for two related programs in a single application if both parts of the program are fully explained in the Program Narrative. 

Proposals will be accepted or rejected for funding based on application score. Funding awarded may be lower than the amount requested. If that is the case, ICJIA will work with the grantee to determine how the program may be carried out with the awarded amount.

#### Will a new NOFO be issued for new applicants in FY2022?

With an appropriation, availability of the funds, and positive program performance, successful FY21 grantees may receive funding to continue their programs for up to an additional 24 months. In addition to these grant continuations, ICJIA intends to issue another NOFO in FY22, but it will depend upon receipt of an appropriation and availability of funds. 

 #### Can an applicant apply for services in one region this year and submit a second application next year for an additional zone?

Unfortunately, the focus of future NOFOs is unknown at this time. 

#### My organization has two locations in the same funding region, but they are in different R3 Zones. Can we combine the proposals for services provided at these two locations into one application or do we have to submit two applications?

Applicants may submit only one application per funding zone per NOFO. If you wish to combine the services at these two locations into one program for this grant application, you would need to include both in one application.

#### Page 21 of the NOFO instructions states that applicants responding to the NOFO must complete a Programmatic Risk Assessment (PRA). Where do I access this PRA?

The Programmatic Risk Assessment (PRA) is not a requirement to apply for this grant. If an application is selected for funding, the successful applicant organization will be provided a PRA to complete prior to the execution of the grant agreement and receipt of funds.

### Questions and Answers from June 5, 2020 to June 11, 2020

<div class="faq-indent">

#### Can a nonprofit organization be a subcontractor for multiple primary applicants?

An organization can be part of only one application, regardless of whether they submit the application or if they are included as a member of a collaborative application. An organization may be selected as a subcontractor for more than one grantee following the execution of the grant agreement between a successful applicant and ICJIA, but in that event the grantee would need to follow the guidelines for competitive bidding for subcontractors per ICJIA’s normal subcontract approval process.

#### Can employees of the organization also be recipients of our services? In other words, are we allowed to hire and pay community members as employees with grant funds?

Yes, if the grantee organization employee also is eligible for services as a resident of an R3 zone, the employee may receive services. Employees may not receive preferential treatment over non-employees.

#### In the budget, can we include salaries to pay for hired "part-time" staff such as a Program Director and Youth Aide?

Applicants should make specific staffing decisions based on the proposed program’s needs, but full- and part-time staff staff salaries may be included in your application.

#### How many clients should our program serve? Are there targets established for how many of our clients are R3 residents if our program will see clients that might not live in R3 zones? Are there targets for number of services provided?

There are no pre-determined targets for either program. Applicants set the goals, objectives, and performance measures for their proposed programs. These goals will be part of the merit-based review of applications and, for successful grantees, will be incorporated into the grant agreement with ICJIA.

Service Delivery programs must provide services to residents of R3 zones. Organizations proposing to serve individuals both within and outside of R3 zones should indicate the estimated breakdown of clients in both areas and how the program will primarily serve R3 residents.
Assessment and Planning program narratives should describe a process to develop a plan centered around R3 zones and include how the plan may affect nearby areas. 

#### Other organizations are reaching out to my organization asking if we would potentially partner with them in a collaborative application. My organization does not normally provide direct services in communities. What part could I play in this program?

Organization collaboratives may seek to include members that do not provide direct services but do provide other benefits to the collaborative. Collaborative members may provide administrative support, facilitate linkages and collaboration between organizations, or other indirect benefits. Collaborative applicants must determine the structure their programs and identify the roles of each member in their applications. 

#### Our community has two R3 zones that are next to one another, and there is some overlap in the zip codes. One of them is designated as a ‘high need’ area, but it seems like that might be just because a portion of the other community shares that zip code.  Was zip code data used in determining a zone’s high need status? If so, then half of one community would have been applied to the other’s determination as a high need zone.

R3 zone designations were identified via census tracts and not necessarily by ZIP code. Data used to identify these areas can be found here: [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources](https://r3.illinois.gov), under ANALYSIS. 

#### Can the funds be used to pay rent for an office space? 

Yes.

#### We are applying to the Chicago Southern R3 zone. Can our services be offered throughout that zone or do they specifically have to be offered in the Zone ID where we are based in the Back of the Yards area?

Services may be offered throughout the zone. Applicants may propose to provide services in any number of R3 zones throughout a funding region. The R3 Zone ID should be provided for Local Preference Points and the ID is based on the applicant organization’s location, but the organization will not be limited to providing services in a single zone.

#### I looked up our organization’s address, and I see an R3 zone ID, but I’m not sure what it stands for. Is there any way of knowing what the boundaries of the R3 zones are? How do they relate to census tracts? How did you decide which tracts to include in which R3 zone?

The R3 Zone ID is an indicator established just for this program to make it easier for grantees to find themselves where they seek to provide services on the eligibility map. Each R3 Zone maps onto a single census tract

R3 Zones are identified by color on the Eligibility map here: [https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility). Click on the color-coded areas to view the zones and their boundaries. Click on a zone to view Census tract and other information. This information also is presented in the table just below the map.

Data used to identify R3 zones can be found here: [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources](https://r3.illinois.gov), under ANALYSIS.

#### Can you provide more information on what we need to be GATA compliant?

Click here for information on how to become GATA compliant: [https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/](https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/). 
ICJIA recommends that potential applicants immediately set up an account at [https://grants.illinois.gov/portal](https://grants.illinois.gov/portal), which also will help you determine what steps you will need to take for GATA compliance. 

#### Does our organization need to be based in Illinois to be eligible?

While an organization’s headquarters may be out of state, some presence in Illinois will be required. Program must serve Illinoisans residing in designated R3 zones.

#### LOCAL PREFERENCE: Applicants have submitted several questions on local preference. Here is more information: 

Local Preference Points offer a boost in scoring to local organizations that provide services in their communities. Many community-based organizations have reported difficulty in obtaining grants when having to compete with established and wealthier organizations from outside of their communities. Local Preference Points will help even the playing field for local organizations trying to overcome initial grant barriers. 

Only local organizations that have offices, workspace, and services rooted within a community should complete the Local Preference Point application questions.

Applicants should not enter addresses of satellite offices, P.O. boxes, or any other locations that do not accurately represent the location of the community organization or where services are provided.

#### The Program Narrative asks me to enter my four-digit R3 Zone ID. However, my R3 Zone ID from the eligibility map does not have four digits. Should I enter zeroes in front of the number to get up to four digits?

Either way is acceptable. The numbers were originally conceived of as four-digit numbers, but the numbers have been simplified. Applications with numbers in either format in the Program Narrative will be accepted.

#### Would it be better for multiple agencies with a plan to serve the same census tract to apply together as a coalition or apply separately as individual agencies?

Either approach is acceptable. While the program does encourage collaboration, it is understood that partnerships may occur formally within an application or informally between grantees. Applicants should decide which approach works better for their communities and their program designs.

#### Must a project partner receive award funds to count as a collaborative partner? Often we have MOUs with project partners who agree to accept referrals and then provide services with existing funding streams.  

Collaborative members are not required to accept grant funding to be a part of an R3 program. The role of such a collaborative member should be explained in the application. 

#### May organizations serve individuals who do not reside in an R3 zone with R3 funding as long as applicants demonstrate that a “significant portion” will come from an R3 zone? 

Yes. Organizations may provide services to any client entering their facilities. However, they must demonstrate in their applications that a significant portion of the client base will be from the R3 zone to be deemed eligible for R3 funding. In addition, any outreach activities, advertising, or marketing geared toward new clients should occur within an R3 zone.

#### How far outside an R3 zone can the service location be located? Our facility is located less than a mile from the closest R3 zone. We serve clients for that R3 zone as well as clients from many other R3 zones that are further away. We would like to propose serving persons from many R3 zones. 

If your facility is located just outside of an R3 zone and many (or all) of your clients are from that or other zones, you may provide services to any client who comes to your facility. However, you must demonstrate in your application that a significant portion of your client base will be from an R3 zone to be deemed eligible for funding. In addition, any outreach activities, advertising, or marketing geared toward new clients should occur within an R3 zone.

#### Must recipients measure and/or report the number of clients contacted through “outreach activities, advertising, or marketing geared toward new clients…within an R3 zone”? 

Applicants are free to set their own goals, objectives, and performance measures based on the design of their proposed programs. If outreach is an important part of the proposed program design, applicants may include outreach activities as part of their goals, objectives, and performance measures. These goals will be part of the merit-based review of applications and, for successful grantees, will be incorporated into the grant agreement with ICJIA. Grantees will be required to report on any goals, objectives, and performance measures included in their proposal.

### Questions and Answers from June 12, 2020 to June 18, 2020

<div class="faq-indent">

#### If the collaborative organizations are located in different funding zones, but the serving area is the same, can we still submit one collaborative application?

Yes. 

#### If we have a main office and a branch office, where the main office is the headquarters and the branch office will be doing the work of the program, should the branch office be listed as a collaborative partner in the application?

No. The branch office should not be listed as a collaborative partner in the application. However, you may include a description of the branch’s location and program involvement in the Program Narrative.

#### If we decide to go with a single-applicant application for an organization that has  headquarters and branches, should we count all employees’ residence in the zone? Or only the employee working at the branch that will implement the program? 

All employees of the organization should be considered in the calculation.

#### Our work will be in one funding region, but multiple funding zones. How do I determine the max funding award if we're working in multiple funding zones?

The maximum (and minimum) amounts are based on funding region. The maximum amount listed for any given region is the most that can be requested in an application, regardless of how many R3 zones are served by the proposed program.

#### If we are certifying that our employees come from an R3 zone, must those employees come from the zone in which our organization is based (and conducts our service), or can they come from any R3 zone?

They may come from (reside in) any R3 zone. 

#### Must all program participants come from the same R3 area our organization is in, or are we allowed to draw from other R3 zones?

Multiple R3 zones may be served by a single program as long as they are all located within the same funding region.

#### My organization provides youth development services to local schools. Schools have been contracting with us directly, but we would like to ease their financial responsibilities by obtaining funding for our services through the grant as well as expand to new schools in the specified R3 needs zone. Our organization will be responsible for hiring service providers to provide direct instruction to students as well as developing the curriculum for the training program. Still, we will be recruiting from the schools. Does this set-up require a collaborative application? If it does require a collaborative application, we would include at least twenty schools, do they all need to be listed as part of the collaborative?

If your organization is requesting R3 funding to hire staff and continue work in schools without reimbursement from the schools, then it appears they would not need to be part of the collaborative. 

If, in the program design, the schools would be receiving grant funds, the schools would need to be included in the application as members of the collaborative and all participating schools should be included in the application.

Additionally, please note that funding for this program cannot be used merely to supplant other funding. In other words, this funding must be used to deliver new, expanded, or enhanced services, rather than simply substitute for a current funding source. 

#### Can we apply as a collaborative and individuals, or we have to do one or the other? 

An application must be either a single organization application or an application on behalf of a collaborative. Only one application for each NOFO can be submitted per applicant in any given funding region. However, you may submit separate applications for each NOFO in a funding region. For example, an applicant may submit a single application for Service Delivery and also join a collaborative in an Assessment and Planning application.

#### Are capital costs allowed as it pertains to training skills? 

This is difficult to answer without specifics, but capital investment, such as purchase of property or making significant property improvements, is generally not allowed with grant funds. Equipment purchases needed for skill building may be allowed.

#### For the program should we define the first 9 months as buildout and implementation then the next 24 months as operational? or do we need to plan for 33 months?  

Unfortunately, we are unable to advise potential applicants on how to plan their programs. In your application, describe in detail your program design and how your program would be implemented.

#### For each zone do we need to submit a separate application? 

No. You do not need to submit a separate application for each R3 zone to be served. 

Separate applications must be submitted for each funding region and/or NOFO. 

Applicants may only submit one application per NOFO per funding region.

#### Are reimbursements for stays in state-licensed recovery homes allowable expenses? Is subsidized employment as part of a transitional jobs program for reentering persons an allowable expense?

Subsidized employment for reentering persons as part of a transitional jobs program may be an allowable expense. Reimbursements for stays in recovery homes are generally covered under other state programs and likely would fall outside of the scope of this NOFO. However, the program design of this funding opportunity was broadened to allow organizations the freedom to define the best way for their programs to operate. 

If you believe that reimbursement for stays in recovery homes (or another program activity) is a necessary part of your program design, you may explain that in your application. The program design, including the role of each activity, will be considered by the application reviewers and would factor into decisions of whether to award funding to your program.


#### I have a question about how the funds can be used for economic development. Can the funds be used to renovate a property this already owned by the organization that will be used to create a light manufacture co-working space, where we want to bring woodshop, photography, and other light textile products to the community. We will have classes for the youth, to teach them these methods. However, the building would need to be renovated and we would need to purchase the equipment. Can the funding be used for this?  

Equipment necessary for economic development and youth development programs could be an allowable expense. Renovation of existing space may be, but with some conditions. The renovation of the space generally cannot dramatically alter the function, size, or value of the building in which it is located. In addition, for both equipment and renovation expenditures, the expenditures should be clearly and extensively explained in the Program Narrative portion of the application in terms of how they will support your proposed program.

</div>

### Questions and Answers from June 19, 2020 to July 2, 2020

<div class="faq-indent">

#### Has the panel of reviewers for the grant applications been finalized?

No. ICJIA is seeking reviewers for the R3 grant applications. Reviewers must come from R3 zones and may not have any conflicts of interest with the pool of applicants they will be reviewing. For example, reviewers may not be assigned to review applications from an organization with whom they are be affiliated. Reviewers also should have some work experience and/or lived experience within at least one of the five R3 program priorities. If you would like to volunteer to review applications, please take this short survey: [https://bit.ly/r3reviewerform](https://bit.ly/r3reviewerform). 

#### Must applicants live and work in Illinois?

While an organization may be headquartered out of state, some presence in Illinois will be required. Program must serve Illinoisans residing in designated R3 zones.

#### Is there a criterion for funds to go to minority owned businesses as primary contractors and organizations in the impacted areas?

There are no specific criteria providing additional points for minority-owned businesses. 

#### Is there a webinar or other recording for people who are interested to apply?

Yes. Three webinars were given and are available on ICJIA’s YouTube channel:
Webinar #1
[https://youtu.be/F98-dkr6p-k](https://youtu.be/F98-dkr6p-k ) 
Webinar #2

#### What specifically is needed and the process to officially offer a notice of intent to apply for this grant?

To submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) to apply for an R3 grant, click the link that corresponds with the grant you wish to apply for, click the blue arrow, and complete and submit the survey. NOIs are NOT required and may be submitted until 11:59 p.m. on July 6, 2020. 

R3 Assessment and Planning NOI link: [https://icjia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5uKwNBK3Vh5eDnT](https://icjia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5uKwNBK3Vh5eDnT) 

R3 Service Delivery NOI link: 
[https://icjia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_82iTmfysXzy6Nwh](https://icjia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_82iTmfysXzy6Nwh) 


#### In regards to the grant amount request, if we put in an amount say $300K, is it an all or nothing request or would we be offered another amount much like a bank does with their credit products? For instance, ICJIA offers $250K instead of the $300K originally requested.

ICJIA will make every effort to meet the requests of applicants selected for funding. However, awards may be reduced or a lesser award may be given depending on funding availability.

#### One of the listed prohibited expenses in the NOFO is capital expenditures. Would this include a purchase of a motorcoach to be used for our services? For example, our project would be turning a motorcoach like vehicle into a full one-stop optical lab which we are able to go to neighborhoods who need our services.

Yes, the purchase of a vehicle would be an example of an unallowable capital expenditure. Vehicles, property, and similar capital expenditures may not be paid for with grant funds.

#### We are discussions with potential partners about planning and service grants. For the lead organizations that are awarded grants, will there be any monies allocated at the beginning of the grant period to prevent the lead organization from having to float costs of the initial months?

Grantees may request advance payment, subject to ICJIA policy. Grantees requesting advances must demonstrate need, itemize expected costs, and comply with Illinois Administrative Code regarding advance payments. For more information, go to: [http://ilga.gov/commission/JCAR/admincode/044/044070000B01200R.html](http://ilga.gov/commission/JCAR/admincode/044/044070000B01200R.html). 

#### I am not sure whether to apply for the service or planning grant. We are currently running a pilot program. What determines into which category we should apply?

The best approach is to read the NOFO instructions and Program Narratives for each grant to determine which would best fit your program (pay particular attention to the Program Design sections). 

The Assessment and Planning NOFO is intended to fund a community-wide process that brings community representatives together to develop an assessment of existing needs and resources related to the five R3 program priorities and  create a comprehensive community plan to provide services in those program priority areas. 

The Service Delivery NOFO, on the other hand, is intended to fund the actual provision of services to community members.

#### We service correctional institutions and our clients and their families on reentry. Our building is located in a Zone other than the specified R3 zones, however the clients we service come from multiple zones and are not located in one Zone.  A percentage are located in the R3 zones. This is particularly true for our Zoom classes. We also service correctional institutions within the zones; would this be included as servicing within the R3 zones?  

Your building does not need to be located in an R3 zone as long as the communities you serve are within R3 zones. In this case, if clients come from/reside in multiple R3 zones, you may apply to provide services to those zones regardless of your organization’s address.

#### I understand that applicants are not to delete any template questions or document formatting.  Are applicants allowed to insert tables/charts into the narrative response sections of the program narrative document?  For example, the statement of need, (what issues…), may we insert a chart when responding (for example) unemployment rates, and demographics?

Yes, applicants may insert tables, charts, and other supporting information into the Program Narrative. These should be included with corresponding Program Narrative questions. They should not be submitted as appendices or extra documents, as they will count against the page limit for the Program Narrative.

#### Our application is focusing on Chicago - South (Englewood) and Chicago - West (Austin, West Garfield Park, etc), however, there are a lot of zones within these funding regions, so do I need to list every single zone ID number (i.e. 310*) within these regions as it states for question 4? I should note alot of these individual zones are all denoted as high-risk.

It is recommended that you list as many as possible. Zones that will have the most program activity should be included. If it is too burdensome to provide a complete list, leave out zones on the periphery of your service area/s and/or zones participants may reside in and travel from to get to your program locations.

#### Can the grant funds be used for salary for staff that operate the project/program? Either a yearly or hourly amount?  

Yes, grant funds can be used for staff salaries if the staff work on the program described in the application. The actual pay status of staff should be used when filling out the budget. For example, if you are budgeting hourly staff, estimate the number of hours they will work on the program and then estimate their salary cost. If staff are paid annually, report the basis as ‘annual,’ and estimate how much of their annual work will be on the program.

#### Since our program does require new equipment, are we able to use our grant money for it to provide the services our program intends to? Think about the equipment you interact with when you get your eyes checked? Or can we use the equipment if it is used to teach and/or educate a new trade for our population of focus or used by optometric students?

Yes, equipment that is reasonable and necessary to run a program may be purchased with grant funds. Applicants should clearly identify the purpose of the equipment in terms of the program design and justify the purchase in the Budget Narrative.

#### Can an organization apply for R3 funding with multiple partnerships? And, if so, are there any particular barriers to doing so?

A single organization can only apply once per grant, per funding region. In other words, they cannot be a part of two applications for a single NOFO within the same funding region of the state. However, if they apply in different funding regions, or for two different grants, they may be included in different partnerships for those different applications. For example, an organization may apply for the Assessment and Planning grant as part of one collaborative group and apply for the Service Delivery grant as part of another collaborative group.

#### Can you give us some clarification on the difference between Implementing Agency and Program Agency?  Also, where would a collaborating agency be listed on the Uniform Application for State Grant Assistance?

An “implementing agency” is the larger, parent organization to a “program agency.” Generally, the program agency is responsible for carrying out the proposed program, while the implementing agency may be responsible for fiscal and administrative support and direction. Some organizations will not have this structure. This structure is most common when governmental entities are involved. For example, a park district in Winnebago County may decide to propose a program for funding; in that case, the park district would be the “program agency,” while Winnebago County would be the “implementing agency.”

Only the responsible applicant must fill out a Uniform Application for State Grant Assistance or be included on one. Other members of a collaborative should not be listed on the Uniform Application for State Grant Assistance, but should instead be included in the Program Narrative.

#### In the R3 RFP it is stated that Food and Beverages are disallowable cost. Does this also include food and beverage purchase to feed the residents in our housing program?

Food and beverage costs are not completely disallowed, but they are subject to restrictions. Food and beverage costs may be allowed for youth program participants, but costs for ongoing food provision for housing program residents would not be allowable under this program. 

#### Our organization is submitting 4 applications for R3; one on the planning side and 3 collaborative applications (we are the lead agency) for the service delivery (3 different funding regions). Do we fill out just one Notice of Intent for Service Delivery and one for Planning or one overall or one for each?

Please fill out a separate Notice of Intent for each application you intend to complete. This will help us ensure that we have recruited a sufficient number of reviewers to manage the volume of applications to be reviewed.

#### The application submission requirements state that a signed application (PDF) is needed along with application (word). Receiving signatures from all parties can be quite challenging due to current remote working conditions since we will need signatures from a number of executive staff. Another challenge is that our policy requires executive staff to be given all application documents so they are able to review prior to signing which is difficult due to unfinished narrative and budget at time of signature request, that takes a minimum of 10 days. Are we able to submit without a signed application considering this will need to be signed again if our organization is awarded funding? If not, can we submit separate signature pages so that each approver does not need to wait for the page to be sent to them with previous signatures?

The approval signatures on the application are needed for ICJIA to ensure that the leadership of the organization applying for the grant approves of the project described in the proposal. As such we do need these approval signatures upon application. However, we recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting prevalence of remote work has made it difficult to have documents personally signed. Therefore, we will accept documents signed with an electronic signature or an email or other document showing that an authorized individual has approved the application to be submitted in lieu of a physical/scanned signature on the application. We will also accept separate signature pages, or submission of separate application and/or budget forms with different signatures applied, as long as all of the necessary signatures to approve the submission of the application are included in the packet.

#### Is it allowable for an agency to work as a collaboration while taking the lead on both the service and planning grants within the same region (please note the collaboration for each grant would have different partners).

Yes, as long as the two applications are for different NOFOs and/or different funding regions. In the scenario described, it seems that the two applications would be for different grants (one for Assessment and Planning and one for Service Delivery), so it would be fine for one organization to submit one application per category with different collaborative members for each.

#### Can funds be used for housing?

Funds may be used to pay for housing costs for reentry programs, but not for capital investment, such as purchasing a building or renovating buildings to provide housing. 

####  If yes, does the budget have to be a line-item budget or can it be rate-based? Currently  Cook County, Illinois Department of Human Services, and the Illinois Department of Corrections pay for recovery housing/transitional housing services based on a daily rate per client. Rates usually cover both housing and ancillary services such as recovery support groups and linkages to job training/education and employment services, 

This program requires a line-item budget.

#### If an itemized budget is required - do you allow for indirect cost or administrative cost?  If yes, do you have a designated percentage/rate? 

Budgets may include indirect costs. Applicants should use their negotiated federal or state indirect cost rate if they have a negotiated rate. If not, applicants should use the de minimis indirect cost rate (10% of the modified total direct cost base).

#### Will those who are applying for the grants have a person to work them or instructions on how to maneuver through the paperwork?

Each applicant whose grant proposal is selected for funding will be assigned a grant monitor who will provide the necessary documents to the grantee to complete and who will provide guidance and assistance during the grant execution process. The grant monitor also will provide technical assistance throughout the grant period, as needed. 

ICJIA staff cannot directly help with the application process, such as preparing or submitting an application. For training on preparing or submitting an application for funding, register for a technical assistance workshop: [https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/technical-assistance](https://icjia.illinois.gov/gata/technical-assistance). 

#### What happens if we are recipients of a certain amount of money, however, at the end we don't end up using it all do to a change in service delivery programming or other circumstances?

Funded organizations may request budget revisions as needed throughout the program period to more effectively expend grant funds. Such a budget revision would still need to adhere to the approved program and would need to be approved by ICJIA before taking effect.  Grantees should notify ICJIA of these budget issues so that excess funds can be reprogrammed to other grantees, as needed. However, the best approach is to carefully develop your program budget to avoid overestimating the funds request for your program.

#### Tab C6- Contractual states: Provide separate budgets for each subaward or contract, regardless of the dollar value and indicate the basis for the cost estimates in the narrative. Describe products or services to be obtained and indicate the applicability or necessity of each to the project. If we are applying as a collaborative with several agencies, does this mean that each agency within the collaborative has to provide a full “R3ServiceBUDGET”, or does the lead applicant insert additional tabs for Section C6 to match the number of agencies in the collaborative application, or is each agency that comprises the collaborative a separate line item on tab C6 (i.e. Agency 1 would be listed on row 9, Agency 2 on row 10, etc.).   

If applying as a collaborative, each member of the collaborative does not need to complete its own full budget template. Instead, additional tabs may be used for each collaborative member. Alternatively, each member of the collaborative could budget separate line item as long as the budget for each is fully described in the narrative. 

Applicants may structure their budgets in a way that best fits their model; ICJIA’s grant management staff may work with selected grantees to edit the budget prior to grant agreement execution.

#### As a collaborative application, are Letters of Support/Commitment from each partner organization acceptable or must it be MOU’s? 

Letters of Commitment are acceptable as long as they indicate that the partner organization is committed to the program described in the application. Letters of Support that just give support for the project may not be sufficient. MOUs and Letters of Commitment will be reviewed to confirm all members of the collaborative are willing to work together on the same project, not just voice support for the project as a whole.

#### My organization did the GATA information for a different 2020-2021 grant.  Do I need to do again for R3?

If you’re referring to your pre-qualification steps, then you should not need to do those again for the R3 grant. You should check to ensure that none of your pre-qualifications have expired (i.e. make sure your SAMS.gov account is still active, you are still listed as being in good standing with the Illinois Secretary of State, etc.) just to be safe. You do not need to take another ICQ. 

Of course, you will need to complete and submit the R3 application materials to apply. Additionally, if your application is selected for funding, you will be asked to complete a new Programmatic Risk Assessment, as they differ by program. However, the basic GATA requirements for pre-qualification carry over across programs and you will not need to complete those again.

#### I just want to make sure I am understanding this correctly: You want us to send a PDF of the Uniform Application and the same document (Uniform Application) as a word file?  

That is correct. ICJIA staff will copy and paste information from the Word file into the grant agreements of selected applicants. Also needed is a PDF that includes the signatures of individuals authorized by your organization to approve the application submission.

#### Will having applications for more than one funding region impact the evaluation of our proposal? In other words, could it hurt our chances of receiving a grant if we submit applications to more than one funding region?

No, the existence of multiple applications in multiple funding regions will not impact the evaluation of each application and will not hurt your chances of receiving a grant.

#### Can you please confirm that the budget should be based on 9 months of service (approx. Sept. 21, 2020 - June 30, 2021) rather than submitting a full 12 month budget?

That’s correct. 

#### May we contract with a private legal firm to support individuals we hope to service should we receive the R3 grant?

It is allowable to contract for legal services, providing all state and federal regulations regarding the provision of legal services are met and services are provided in the context of an eligible R3 program design.

If the legal services are being provided for a client’s benefit, rather than the benefit of your organization, then the contract for services would likely be considered a subaward rather than a contract. If that’s the case, consider adding the private law firm as a collaborative partner to provide the services or carrying out a competitive selection process to identify a subawardee.

#### We are planning on submitting some letters of support from elected officials and other to bolster our application. Are these allowed to be sent with an application?

You may send letters of support, but they will not be considered as part of the application review process.

#### How was the NOFO announced? Is there messaging material? When was the town hall and press release?

ICJIA announced the two R3 funding opportunities on May 21, 2020, with a press release distributed statewide, an email to subscribers of the [CJ Dispatch](https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/manage/optin?v=001MqUcqqvjwLCJXlLMSWbTe3zHHmEQgFeBuHvBcJWTbwgrxFbDSGx4HSUPpI6DJWMUPgbljtLxffqIcGFTgCnr-auak88ybvRxpoJlTMGPtZs%3D), and via its social media channels ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ICJIA/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ICJIA_Illinois), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/icjia)). 

The Office of the Lieutenant Governor hosted a Town Hall on the R3 program on Friday, May 18. 

Messaging material is available. Email ICJIA Public Information Officer Cristin Evans for more information: [Cristin.Evans@illinois.gov](Cristin.Evans@illinois.gov).

### Questions and Answers from July 3, 2020 to July 9, 2020

<div class="faq-indent">

#### Will additional grantees have the opportunity to submit for and receive funding during the next application cycle for FY22?

ICJIA anticipates having the ability to offer another R3 grant opportunity in FY22 for new grantees. However, fund availability remains uncertain until a state budget is passed with an appropriation sufficient to expand the scope of the program to additional grantees.

#### Can you confirm that funding can be used to pay client stipends while they are in a vocational training program?

R3 funding may be used to pay client stipends for vocational training and other participant support costs, provided that they are justified as necessary and reasonable. Please make sure that your budget narrative details the stipends so that reviewers understand the purpose of the costs for your overall program.

#### In the Program Narrative, on the Goals, Objectives and Performance measures table- is it necessary to have process objectives and outcome objectives?

The table provided is a template that can be adapted to fit any program. It is not intended to be restrictive or to force the applicant into a format that does not match the program. Thus, if that section does not match your goals and objectives for the program, completion is not mandatory.

#### Would allowable costs under the R3 program include those that are necessary to operate programs under conditions of social distancing such as tablets, laptops, and software.  Will a portion of the cost to upgrade our 15 year-old network switches and wi-fi system also be allowable?  Also, one of the core principles of the R3 program involve engaging the community in determining the needs of the community.  We would like to designate a space that could be used to host community engagement events, however, the lighting in this space is over 14 years-old.  Will R3 funds cover the cost of upgrading the lighting for this community space?

Yes, costs for computing supplies needed to operate programs under conditions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the replacement or upgrade of existing equipment (including network equipment, lighting, etc) are allowable if they are necessary for the program. However, costs of any equipment or upgrades that would be used by the organization as a whole (not solely by the R3 program) must be allocated appropriately to the other programs or uses that it supports and not charged solely to the R3 program. In other words, if the network and wi-fi system is used within your organization to support other programs, the upgrade cannot be 100% paid for with R3 funds. In this case, the grantee must detail  in the Budget Narrative how much of the total cost is paid for by requested R3 funds and how that allocation amount was derived.

#### We’ll be applying as the lead org, but for each of our partner orgs that will be a subaward, do they need to submit a full budget, or do we just include their total award amount as a subaward?

Partner organizations applying as part of a collaborative are not required to submit a full budget. The anticipated amount of each subaward should be listed on the Contractual tab of your budget.  Some explanation of what each subgrantee’s budget might be in the Budget Narrative section of the Contractual tab is recommended to inform application reviewers.

#### Regarding the allotted funding per R3 zone, we are in the "collar" region for the service delivery NOFO so our grant range is $25k - $1.3M per grant.  Is the total amount allotted to each region noted somewhere? Per the webinar, grant funds will be allocated based on a ranking of the scores of the applicants so I'm trying to determine how much altogether is allocated to each region.

The full amount available per NOFO per funding region is equal to double the maximum available amount per application. So, using your example, if the maximum award amount per grant for Service Delivery in the Collar region is $1.3M, then the total amount available for Service Delivery grants in the Collar region is $2.6M. This rule applies to all funding regions for each NOFO.

#### We noticed that 20 pages is the max for the service delivery application; is it the same max for collaborative applications?

Yes. However, Letters of Commitment/Memoranda of Understanding between collaborative members will not count toward the 20-page limit.

#### A member of our collaborative team indicated that Memorandum’s of Understanding are due this week, ahead of the July 20, 2020 full application due date. Could you please clarify when MOU’s are due and the method of submission if they are required prior to July 20, 2020?

Memoranda of Understanding are to be submitted with  application materials, which are due at 11:59 p.m. on Monday, July 20, 2020.

#### The stakeholders we aim to engage are challenged by the profound impacts of COVID-19 and longstanding inequities. Recognizing that daily living challenges may hinder participation, we would like to include budget line items to help them overcome barriers to participation in the planning effort, specifically food/beverage offered during planning sessions (as possible) and/or PPE and comfort kits to protect health and safety). If the rationale we provide is clear, would these costs be allowed?   

Costs necessary for carrying out program activities made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as computer equipment and supplies needed for remote work, PPE, and additional cleaning for workspaces, would be allowed if the rationale is clear. Food and beverage costs, however, are only supported  in limited circumstances (generally, for youth participants of program activities).  Food and beverage costs would not be supported for grantee staff or for planning sessions.

#### We plan to include letters of support from community partners and civic leaders that may participate in planning (but not receive funding).* Are there any page limitations for letters of support (beyond the 20pp narrative)? Can we include other attachments (e.g. map of targeted zones)? 

No additional documents beyond those requested as part of the application packet will be reviewed. As such, there are no requirements attached to any additional documents, as they are not required for submission.

#### When determining the Modified Total Direct Cost, what does "participant support costs" mean?

Participant support costs include stipends, travel costs, and other expenditures paid for participants to attend conferences, training sessions, and other such activities held by a grantee. It does not include costs for employees to run the event.

#### Does the award max for the funding region include the indirect cost you can charge? For example, if the cap is $200,000, can you ask for $200,000 and the additional 10% indirect cost to request $220,000, or do direct and indirect combined have to fall under the funding max?

The maximum award amount represents the full amount an application can ask for, which includes the indirect cost amount. If the cap is $200,000, the combined direct and indirect costs may total no more than $200,000.

#### I missed the deadline to submit a Notice of Intent. Am I still able to apply for the funding opportunity?

Yes. Upon receipt of a Notice of Intent (NOI), ICJIA reviews the potential applicant’s pre-qualification status and provides assistance if problems are noted. However, a NOI is not required. The lack of an NOI submission will not impact how an application is reviewed or scored.

#### I know we can use the grant for rent, but can we use it for a mortgage payment on a commercial property?

No. Grant funds cannot be used to pay mortgage payments.

#### Can we set aside in our budget for honorariums for non-payroll employees who do work for us?

Honoraria can generally be paid to speakers at events on a per-event basis. If you intend to pay non-payroll employees for program-related work, they should be classified as a contractor on the contractual page. Grantees will be required to develop a contract in these instances and the contract must be approved by ICJIA prior to payment.

#### Where in the budget do I put in malpractice insurance or any type of non-health insurance? Is it under fringe benefits or indirect costs? 

Malpractice insurance or other non-health insurance can be included under fringe benefits only if paid by the organization and if they are generally calculated as part of the fringe benefits package for all employees. Organizations may not use funds to offer fringe benefits to grant-funded employees that their other employees will not receive; all employees of an organization must receive the same fringe benefits. This cost should only be included under fringe benefits if it can be allocated directly to each employee. If it is impossible to determine how much of the overall malpractice insurance cost can be attributed to each employee, it would be better to include it as an indirect cost.

#### We are planning on applying for R3 funding to increase our out of school time youth offerings.  Are we able to request funding to purchase a vehicle to transport youth to and from our program?

Generally, vehicle purchases are considered unallowable capital expenditures as it can be more economical to rent a vehicle, as needed. However, if you can show that a vehicle purchase is more economical than renting and that a vehicle is an integral part of the proposed program, you may include it in your budget for consideration.

#### Could we lease a vehicle?

Yes. A lease would not be considered a capital expenditure and, therefore, could considered allowable as a contractual cost. Provide an explanation of need for the leased vehicle and explain why a lease would be the most economical approach.

#### Is it permissible to include additional attachments with the application other than those specifically mentioned in the NOFO?  For example, items like a program logic model, resume of the program director, examples of program materials, etc.?  Or must all such information fit within the 20 page narrative limit?

Letters of Commitment/Memoranda of Understanding between collaborative members will not count toward the 20-page limit. No additional documents beyond those requested as part of the application packet will be reviewed.

### Questions and Answers from July 10, 2020 to July 16, 2020

<div class="faq-indent">

#### My question is are we to choose the areas in which we are planning (e.g. economic development, reentry) OR are the planning grants to assess ALL of the areas identified in the NOFO?  

Either approach is fine. You can either perform an assessment to determine which of the program priorities are needed and then choose what you’ll focus on based on that assessment, or if you already know what program priorities you would like to work with or have the background in, you can perform an assessment and planning process for what is needed within those areas. Either way, it will be the applicant’s responsibility to explain the approach you decide on and why that approach was chosen.

#### Is there any way to still submit a notice of intent?

While the deadline has passed, note that the notice of intent is merely recommended, not a required step. You are still able to submit the application by the due date. Without an NOI, we will not be able to verify your GATA pre-qualification prior to application and provide technical assistance, so please make sure to verify that you have all of your pre-qualification steps completed.

#### Do all employees who qualify within an R3 area need to fill out a Certification of Employee Local Residence form? or is it one filled out per agency certifying 50% of employees qualify?  

No—only one form is required for the application. You do not need to submit one form per employee.

#### I have a question on signatures on the application cover page.  It asks for three signature – two from the Implementing Agency and one from the Program Agency.  We would be acting as both.  Can you clarify specifically what signatures are needed?

If the implementing agency and program agency are the same, you can complete the implementing agency signatures and leave the program agency signatures blank.

#### If 50% of the staff do not live in the R3 zone will our application be denied?

No. The 50% threshold you refer to is only related to the local preference points, not your eligibility to apply. You may not receive those few points, but the rest of your application is eligible to be scored.

#### There is a 20-page limit for the Program Narrative however the narrative template format and instructions are about six and a half pages long.  Applicants are instructed to NOT make any changes to the template. Does this mean that the final narrative can be 26 1/2 pages long?  Or, does this mean that the applicant's responses can only be 13 1/2 pages?

Applicants may delete instructions (but not the questions) from the Program Narrative document. The final document, including the questions and tables, cannot be longer than 20 pages total.

#### Are footer and page numbers allowed in bottom page margins?

Yes.

#### We are renovating a park playground for use by 2500 youth who live in an underserved neighborhood. Would this project qualify or is it considered a capital project?

Renovating a playground is an allowable activity that would not be considered a capital expenditure.

#### Can you please let me know where I can find the list of certifications/assurances referred to on page 3 of the Uniform Application form?

For this NOFO the only eligible certifications are the certification of local employee residence (if applicable—only if seeking the local preference points based on employee residence) and the general assurance that your organization is eligible to receive state funds.

#### My organization submitted our application for a SAM.gov account last night but it appears as though it could take up to 10 business days for approval.  Is there any way to expedite a SAM account or are we running the risk of not being able to submit our R3 proposal?

You are still able to apply for the grant, as long as the application for a new/updated SAM.gov account has been made. Your account will need to be active and correct before any grant agreement can be executed, but your application will be reviewed as long as the request to update was submitted prior to the application deadline.

#### In the R3 Narrative application for Service Delivery, the section on Goals, Objectives, and Performance Measures does not show a point score. How is this section evaluated in an applicant’s overall point score?

The “Goals, Objectives, and Performance Measures” and “Implementation Schedule” sections are included to help build successful applicants’ grant agreements. They are not directly scored, but reviewers may consider the proposed goals and objectives in the context of reviewing the overall program design.

#### For the personnel section of the budget, ICJIA requests a job description for each role. How in depth do you want these descriptions and should they be added as a separate document or other the personnel narrative?

It is your decision how much information you want to include, but the job description should be included within the budget template in the narrative section, not on a separate document. Separate documents that are not part of the application packet will not be reviewed. Job descriptions should be sufficient to explain the role of the employee in the program but need not be full descriptions that include detail on non-program-related tasks.

#### Do we need to provide matching funds to apply?

No.

#### We are all working remotely and are planning to sign the uniform pdf using electronic signatures.  Is that acceptable?   This seems like a difficult time for getting original signatures.

Yes, we accept electronic signatures on PDF documents in lieu of ink signatures.

#### I have a question regarding the payout of the grant once awarded.  Will all funds be distributed at the beginning of the grant or will they be distributed semiannually or quarterly?  

While we are still working on the details, we know that there will be an opportunity for successful applicants/grant recipients to request advance payment. Most likely a portion of the funds will be provided up front to cover immediate start-up costs and initial months of program operation, with monthly payments occurring after that. We do not anticipate providing the full amount up front, due to state and federal guidelines on advance payment.

#### Can you tell me where to find the form required in this passage? “Applicants are also required to submit a financial and administrative risk assessment via an Internal Controls Questionnaire (ICQ) for state fiscal year 2021 before July 1, 2020 (NOFO close date) and obtain approval from their cognizant agencies before execution of the grant agreement. Delay in obtaining SFY21 ICQ approval will result in a delay in grant execution.”

The ICQ is available via the State of Illinois GATA Grantee Portal. Any applicant with an account at https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/ should be able to view their account and access the ICQ from there.

#### We are all up to date regarding eligibility but the portal continues to produce an error making it impossible to register for the upcoming grant. Would you happen to know who we could contact?

If you’re having trouble with the Grantee Portal (https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/) I suggest reviewing the FAQ page for that site here: https://www2.illinois.gov/sites/GATA/grantee/pages/granteeportalfaq.aspx. 

#### We saw that cash advances may be available to lead applicants. We are trying to assess our need for this. One process component we are not clear on is the drawdown procedures for collaborative applications. It is our understanding that all subawardee partners need to submit an invoice with documentation to the lead applicant. Must the lead applicant pay the subawardee prior to drawing down grant funds? Or can the lead applicant request draw down (with subawardee documentation) and then pay all partners? The concern is around cash flow and for the lead applicant being able to advance a large sum to partners each month while waiting on the drawdown to be processed. Clarity on what is required when drawdown funds is appreciated.

We are still working on the details of how the advance payments would work, since this is the first time our state grantees are able to request these advances. As such, I can only speak tentatively right now—please be aware that some of the procedures below may change by the time any grant agreements are executed. At the moment, it appears that lead applicants will be able to request a working capital advance payment that would cover an initial period of program performance, including payments to subgrantee partners. Grantees would need to submit an estimate for the advance payment needed, which can include these subawards. We hope that this method will reduce cash flow issues to all grantees by allowing that initial advance payment to cover the first few months of expenses rather than relying on the lead entity’s reserves.

#### In the Program Narrative, for the Program Staffing section, are you looking for just staff information of the lead applicant or all collaborative partners?

This section should outline, to the best of the applicant’s ability, the staffing that would go into carrying out the program described. Because there can be a great deal of variety in collaborative applications regarding partners’ roles in completing the program, it is impossible to specify who should be included. But applicants should make sure to include information about any partner’s staffing if that is relevant to how the program will be carried out.

#### If we reference articles/research in the narrative is there a preferred method for citations?

There is no preferred method for citations. Any generally-accepted method to cite other sources will be accepted for the purposes of this application.

#### Our organization does have a NICRA.  Are we limited to using the full NICRA amount to the first 25K of contractual services since it is Federal pass through dollars?

All of the terms of your organization’s NICRA will be applied to your indirect cost calculations for this grant. If your NICRA specifies that only the first $25k of contractual services is included in the base when calculating indirect costs, then you would be limited to that calculation. However, if your NICRA does not include this restriction, then it would not be applied to you for this grant.

#### For the planning grant may we focus on these areas and the places in which we have relationships?  Or must we plan for the whole funding region?  Can we break out some of the areas rather than apply for the entire region?

It is the applicant’s decision as to the range or extent of the proposed project. It is not a requirement to serve an entire funding region. Therefore, you are able to propose to serve only the R3 zones in which you already have a presence if that fits best with your program design. Please note that you would need to identify the R3 zones to be served in your application, and you would need to describe your decision as to why that is your proposed program area so that reviewers understand the choices you made in your program design.

#### Are organizations required to have indirect costs?  

No, it is up to the applicant whether you wish to include indirect costs in your budget.

#### Since there is no occupancy tab in the budget spreadsheet, we plan to include allocated direct costs in the fringe tab. Our allocated costs include direct costs such as rent and utilities that are allocated across grants based on salaries charged each month. Is this the correct tab to include these direct costs?

Ordinarily, occupancy costs would be included on this budget under the contractual tab. However, it is up to the applicant to decide how best to list the costs in their budgets, and application reviewers will not be penalizing applicants based on how costs are categorized (only on whether those costs are reasonable, justified for the program, etc). If your application is successful, we may ask you to move the costs to another category, but for the purpose of the grant application you may place them where you think they fit best.

#### Please look at the R3 application Narrative template.  Starting after Question 16, there are discussions of Goals, Objectives, and Performance Measures followed by Implementation Schedule.  Are these supposed to be submitted as part of the application or are they just including this information for after you receive the award?  

These tables need to be submitted as part of the application. They can be referenced by application reviewers to evaluate the success of the program design described in the application. If your application is successful, they may also be used to create your grant agreement.

#### If we are applying as a collaborative, should we submit the Certification of Employee Local Residence Form for the lead applicant?

Collaboratives can receive local preference points based on the location of the collaborative members, rather than employee residence. Only single organization applicants should complete the Certification of Employee Local Residence Forms.

#### Is it impossible for me to complete the application without attending a GATA technical assistance session?

Not at all. While the technical assistance helps applicants become eligible for grants and often provides good tips for applying, it is not a requirement for application. Applications can be filled out regardless of attendance at a technical assistance session.

#### My understanding is that the FFATA section of the budget template is not applicable to this grant. Meaning there is nothing to fill out or complete in this section. Am I correct?

You should still fill out the FFATA section of the budget with whatever information you have for that section. Even though the grant is state funded, we are still required to collect the information on the FFATA page.

#### Since this grant has no Matching Funds requirement, is there anything we need to complete with this form?

No. You may leave the Matching Funds section of the application/budget template blank.

#### We are excited about the R3 grant opportunity, but became aware of it too late to pull together a solid proposal. I'm wondering when the next funding cycle will become available so we can be prepared to submit an application.

I’m sorry to hear that you weren’t able to apply during this phase of applications. I can’t be certain when the next funding cycle will begin, but it seems likely that there will be another Notice of Funding Opportunity released next winter. However, please keep an eye on the website at https://r3.illinois.gov; if not all funding is exhausted after this current round of applications, it is possible that another NOFO will be released during this fiscal year. If so, it will be posted to that website.

#### At the bottom of most sections there is space for a narrative: Personnel, Fringe Benefits, etc. Are those narratives the only space to give more detail for that budget category? Or should we do another narrative/summary that has all sections in one document?

You should not do a separate budget narrative with all sections in one document. The narrative sections at the bottom of the tabs on the budget template should be used to describe in more detail the items of cost you list above, and to explain what the use of the items is in the program (and, if applicable, how the cost was estimated).

#### In Question 3(a) of the R3ServiceNARRATIVE document, is the responsible applicant considered a collaborative member?

#### Sample Scenario:

#### Responsible Applicant - located within R3 Zone ID 1
#### Collaborative Member 1 - not located within any R3 Zone
#### Collaborative Member 2 - located within R3 Zone ID 2
#### Collaborative Member 3 - not located within any R3 Zone

#### In the above case, will the group be considered as having 50% collaborative members within an R3 Zone such that they qualify for said classification? Or will the group be considered as non-compliant with the 50% collaborative member classification since the responsible applicant is excluded?

The responsible applicant is considered a collaborative member, and, in the scenario you provided, the application would be eligible for local preference points based on 50% of collaborative members being within an R3 zone.

#### The Excel Uniform Grant Budget Template contains sections C1 through C7.  The Illinois Grants we usually work with have 17 sections.  For example, training costs are usually listed in section 12, telecommunications costs are usually listed in section 11, and transportation costs for clients are usually listed in section 14.  Also, indirect costs are usually listed in section 17.  For the R3 grant, in what section would you like us to list these costs?

It is up to you where you place the expenses that usually go into different tabs of the budget template. You will not be penalized for the category you choose to place the costs into on the budget, as long as the costs are reasonable and necessary for the program.

#### We are a collaborative made up of 4 agencies.  The expenses for the implementing agency will be listed in the various expense categories, C1 though C7.  The expenses for the three program agencies will be listed in section C6.  Can the three program agencies include their indirect costs as a part of the contractual services we will list in section C6?

Yes, subgrantees (partners in a collaborative application) can also claim indirect costs, which would be incorporated into the amount listed on the contractual page of the budget.

#### The Budget/Budget Narrative is NOT included in the 20-page count for the Program Narrative.  Correct?

Correct. The budget template (which contains the budget narrative fields) is a separate document and is not counted towards the 20-page limit for the Program Narrative (which is a Word document).

#### Should I submit a budget narrative separate from the narrative in the budget excel file?

No. Please put the narrative for each section of the budget into the space at the bottom of the corresponding tab within the Excel file. Please do not submit a separate document just for your budget narrative.

#### We are planning to submit a collaborative application, where my organization would be the Grantee and the collaborating organization would be the subrecipient. The collaborating organization has already received a government-approved indirect cost rate. As the would-be Grantee (given our collaborator's existing indirect cost rate) would my organization be restricted in our ability to request either: (a) the de minimis rate; or (b) a rate that differs from our collaborative partner’s established rate?

Your collaborative partner’s indirect cost rate would not impact yours. They should use their negotiated indirect cost rate for their subaward, and you should either use a negotiated indirect cost rate (if you have one) or, if you do not have a NICRA, you are free to take the de minimis 10% rate regardless of the NICRA for your subgrantee.

#### Our organization is applying for a Service Delivery grant through R3 as a collaborative. We understand that organizations may be included in only one application submitted per funding region. One of the collaborative members included in our application will also be mentioned as a partner in the narrative of a different application in the same R3 region. However, they will not be included in that application's budget. Is this allowable?

Yes, this is allowable. The partner would be able to be mentioned in another application’s narrative, but cannot be included in the budget or in the MOUs of another application.

#### If our proposed service area covers multiple R3 Zone IDs, how is the service area determined as “high need”?  Would the service area require over 50% “high needs” R3 Zone IDs?

As long as at least one of the R3 zones you propose to serve is designated as a ‘high need’ zone, you would receive the points for serving a high need zone.

#### Where will we find the Programmatic Risk Assessment for ICIJA?  In addition, when does it need to be completed?

The Programmatic Risk Assessment is not part of the application process. It does not need to be completed unless your application is chosen for funding, at which point ICJIA will provide you with the PRA questionnaire to fill out.

#### What sorts of details do we need to include in our budget when it comes to supplies?

Your budget should detail the supplies that you project will be needed for the program, but you need only list the type of supplies, quantity needed, cost per item, and (in the narrative) how the cost was estimated. You do not need to provide the name of the vendor or other details unless it is relevant to how your costs were estimated.

#### If part of your proposal includes hiring individuals in the Cook South Region does that mean we should consider the proposal as contributing to economic development as well or not?  

No, simply hiring staff does not qualify a program as an ‘economic development’ program in terms of the R3 program priorities. The program would need to have some activities or services geared towards economic development in the community.

#### If you are increasing awareness of a new service are marketing costs allowable...e.g., posters, advertising, flyers, etc. 

Yes, some advertising/marketing/public awareness costs could be allowable for this purpose. Such costs would need to be justified as reasonable and as necessary for the program. Also note that any published materials would need to be approved by ICJIA prior to the expenditure being made.
