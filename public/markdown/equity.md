## What process was used to ensure equitable distribution of funds across all communities in need?

- First, areas with the following considerations were mapped by ZIP code:

    - Highest rates of gun injury: Hospitalization rate of > 9.1 per 10,000 residents or gun injury death rate of > 1.6 per 10,000 residents. (Source: IDPH)
		
    - High rates of unemployment Greater than 8.3% unemployment rate. (Source: American Community survey)
		
    - Highest child poverty rates: Greater than 25.4% of children under six-years-old living at or below 100% of the federal poverty line from 2013-2017. (Source: American Community Survey)
		
    - Highest rates of commitments to and returns from the Illinois Department of Corrections in communities: Greater than 70.6 prison commitments per 10,000 residents or greater than 36.3 prison returns per 10,000 residents between 1960 and 2018. (Source Criminal History Record Information System; Prison and Mandatory Supervised Release files)

- Second,  DCEO identified areas that are high need, underserved, and disproportionately impacted by historical economic disinvestment. These are called Distressed Income Areas. The areas also were mapped.

- The finalized maps determined R3 eligible areas across the state (by ZIP code). 

- Only agencies within these eligible areas were allowed to apply for funding and only individuals residing in these areas may receive R3 services. 

## Were applicants in all communities notified of these grant opportunities? 

Extensive outreach notifying communities across the state of the opportunity drew nearly 400 applications.

## How were the applications reviewed? 

Reviewers scored applications in accordance with the scoring criteria outlined in the notice of funding opportunity. Applications underwent an extensive review. Applicants were ranked from highest to lowest within each funding region. ICJIA recommended funding  applicants with the highest scores within each region. 

The R3 Board considered ICJIA’s recommendations and R3 Grant Sub-committee recommendations, which included an equity scan. Equity scores were based on program and collaborative partner locations (R3 eligible), whether staff resided in an R3 zone, whether the project served a high-need area, and the applicant’s community involvement and restorative justice efforts. At the R3 Grant Sub-committee’s request, some applicants were invited to give more information on these dimensions of their applications. 

The subcommittee is a diverse body comprised of elected officials, practitioners, and community members, including individuals with lived experience of the justice system.

## Who reviewed the applications? 

A reviewer interest survey was shared widely to recruit external reviewers from R3-eligible communities. Reviewers were asked to disclose their demographic details, address, and any work or lived experience in civil legal aid, economic development, re-entry, violence prevention, and youth development (R3 program priorities). 

Efforts were made to allow reviewers to score applications submitted from their own communities while preventing conflicts of interest. 

Reviewers were required to attend two trainings—one on cultural competence and mitigating bias and another in the specifics of grant application review.
