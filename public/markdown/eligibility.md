## R3 Map

This map illustrates eligible areas designated for Restore, Reinvest, and Renew (R3) Program grant funding. Areas were identified using community-level data on gun injury, child poverty, unemployment, and state prison commitments and returns, combined with Disproportionately Impacted Areas identified by the [Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity](https://www2.illinois.gov/dceo/Pages/default.aspx) (DCEO). Together with the R3 Board, [ICJIA](https://icjia.illinois.gov) will award grant funds to community organizations that support economic development, provide violence prevention and reentry services, and offer youth development and civil legal aid. A notice of funding opportunity for the grants will be released in the coming months.
