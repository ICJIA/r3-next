## Eligible Applicants

Types of eligible applicants are nonprofit organizations, local units of government, and tax-exempt faith-based organizations. Other organizations may also be eligible to join the proposed program as members of a collaborative. Click here to [learn more about collaboratives](/collaboratives) in the R3 program.

## Eligible Service Areas

In order to be eligible for R3 grant funding, the activities proposed in a submitted grant application must be focused on a designated R3 zone (the green-shaded zones in the map below). This means that an assessment and planning process proposed under the Assessment and Planning NOFO must be centered around an R3 zone, and services provided under the Service Delivery NOFO must be provided within the R3 zone.

Organizations applying for funding do not need to be located within these green-shaded R3 zones, but applications will be given priority if they are submitted by organizations within these R3 zones, if they are on behalf of collaboratives that contain such organizations, or if the majority of their employees live within R3 zones.

To find out if an area is an eligible R3 zone for this program, the search bar at the top right of the map can be used to search for an address. The “+” and “-“ buttons on the left side of the map can also be used to zoom in and find out if the area to be served is one of the designated R3 zones.
