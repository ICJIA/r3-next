## Eligible Applicants

In order to be eligible, organizations must have a DUNS number, a SAM.gov account, a Grants.gov account, be in good standing with the Illinois Secretary of State, and not be on the state no-pay list (See [Prequalification Steps](/resources#icjia-prequalification-steps) for details). Common types of eligible applicants are nonprofit organizations, local units of government, and tax-exempt faith-based organizations. Other organizations may also be eligible to join the proposed program as members of a collaborative. Click here to [learn more about collaboratives](/collaboratives) in the R3 program.

## Eligible Service Areas

In order to be eligible for R3 grant funding, the activities proposed in a submitted grant application must be focused on a designated R3 zone (the shaded zones in the map below). This means that an assessment and planning process proposed under the Assessment and Planning NOFO must be centered around an R3 zone, and services provided under the Service Delivery NOFO must be provided within the R3 zone.

Organizations applying for funding do not need to be located within these R3 zones, but applications will be given priority if they are submitted by organizations within these R3 zones, if they are on behalf of collaboratives that contain such organizations, or if the majority of their employees live within R3 zones.

### Using the R3 Map to Determine Eligibility and Funding Level

To find out if an address is eligible for R3 funding, or to get information on an R3 zone for application purposes, enter the address into the search bar (top left) or zoom in (+) on the address on the map. Any address appearing in a color-coded, shaded area is within an R3 zone and eligible for funding. Click the shaded area to see its R3 Zone ID and funding information needed for the grant application's Program Narrative.

*Tip:* After searching for and locating an address, you may need to zoom out (-) before you determine whether that address is in an R3 zone or not.
