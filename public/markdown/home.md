R3 grants fund programs in Illinois communities that have been harmed by violence, excessive incarceration, and economic disinvestment.

R3 grants fund programs in five areas:

- Civil Legal Aid

- Economic Development

- Reentry

- Violence Prevention

- Youth Development

The communities that are eligible for R3 funding were identified, in part, by their rates of gun injuries, child poverty, unemployment and incarceration. [View this map](/eligibility) to see if organizations in your community are eligible for an R3 grant.

Nonprofit organizations, local governments, faith-based organizations, businesses, and other community or neighborhood associations may apply for grants individually or in a collaborative with other groups. Find out more [about collaboratives here](/collaboratives).
