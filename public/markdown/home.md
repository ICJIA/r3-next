Many communities in Illinois have been harmed by violence, excessive incarceration, and economic issues. R3 grants support efforts to restore, reinvest in, and renew these communities.</p>

R3 grant-eligible zones were identified, in part, by community gun injury, child poverty, and unemployment rates and incarceration levels. View [this map](/eligibility) to see if organizations in your community are eligible for an R3 grant.

Organizations may apply for grants individually or in partnership with other groups as a “collaborative.” Find out [more about collaboratives here](/collaboratives).
