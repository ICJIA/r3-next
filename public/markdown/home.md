# Restore, Reinvest, and Renew (R3)

Many communities in Illinois have been harmed by violence, excessive incarceration, and economic issues. R3 grants support efforts to restore, reinvest in, and renew these communities.

The grants funded by this program should address the five R3 Program Priorities:

- Civil Legal Aid

- Economic Development

- Reentry

- Violence Prevention

- Youth Development

R3 grant-eligible zones were identified, in part, by their rates of community gun injury, child poverty, unemployment and incarceration levels. [View this map](/eligibility) to see if organizations in your community are eligible for an R3 grant.

Organizations may apply for grants individually or in partnership with other groups as a collaborative. Organizations eligible to apply for this funding are nonprofit organizations, local units of government, and religious organizations. Other types of organizations, like businesses and community or neighborhood associations, are also eligible to be members of a collaborative.
